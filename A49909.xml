            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE following Diſſertations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch Variety of Learning, and Liberty of Thought, out of the common road of Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Divines (who generally confine themſelves within the Rules and Pale of the Church) that the Publiſhing of them in Engliſh was thought neceſſary for the inſtructing and poliſhing of thoſe, who imploy their happy Hours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Study of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> 'Tis true, Two very <hi>Reverend Prelates</hi> of our own Church have lately treated of theſe Matters not without Reflecting on the Author Mr. <hi>Le Clerk;</hi> yet 'tis no ill manners to cloath him in the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:58698:3"/>Language, that the Juſtice and Reaſon of their Contempt and Accuſations may the more clearly appear.</p>
            <p>I am not inſenſible of the many Calumnies fixt on the Learned Author upon the account of theſe <hi>Diſſertations,</hi> and the <hi>Letters</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Publiſh'd concerning <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and the <hi>Lives of ſome Fathers,</hi> yet his late <hi>Treatiſe of the Cauſes of Incredulity, and the Truth of Chriſtianity;</hi> hath diſſipated all thoſe Aſperſions, and demonſtrates to the World, that he could never give any occaſion to Infidels or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to inſult the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, or the Lines of the Church; 'tis maliciouſly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that he hath forgot to reckon his own Writings amongſt his many Cauſes of Deiſm, and Scepticiſm; for tho in his <hi>Juvenile</hi> Paſtimes at <hi>Saumur,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> he might ſow ſome wild Tares, and run beyond the bounds of Diſcretion in Matters of Faith; yet by culture and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of years, he arriv'd at that ſtrength and preſence of mind, that all his Productions became chaſte, and very charming, inſomuch that the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> adopted him into the Number of her Profeſſors, where he adorns the Oriental Chair, and deſerves to ſhine in a more Noble Sphere; but the Climate, we live in, is too groſs to receive ſuch a fine and exalted <hi>Genius,</hi> born to illuminate the dark Myſteries of Antiquity, and to let us into the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum;</hi> for certainly never any Mortal came
<pb facs="tcp:58698:3"/>better prepar'd to unvail the Beauty of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> many great Endowments meeting in him; a ſingular Penetration, vaſt reading and Study, a profound skill in the Languages with an univerſal erudition, a clear Judgment, an honeſt Candor, and a Sublimity above Party or Faction; Talents not very common among Thoſe who have the Honour to unlock thoſe Venerable Archives.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bible</hi> without diſpute contains more good Morals, and more hidden Treaſures than all the Volumes of the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> the <hi>Vatican,</hi> or <hi>Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leian</hi> Libraries, and therefore our Libertines have no reaſon to deride the pains taken to open them.</p>
            <p>But ſome cry out aloud, there lurks a Snake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Graſs, and Venom ſprouts out of the Mouth of the tempting Serpent; Beware of his winding Inſinuations, and his gentile Turnings. Oh incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Jealouſie! that will not diſtinguiſh between Superſtition and Religion, between Godlineſs, and Gain, or between the Ancient and Modern <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> A Man muſt be of a very ſower ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body, that will not bear an innocent Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, eſpecially in an Age and Kingdom, where <hi>Nullius in Verba</hi> is the <hi>Motto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Criticks and Philoſophers have always claim'd a particular ſort of Liberty, and Boldneſs, which the wiſeſt States have thought fit to diſpenſe with; for Truth is not eaſily come at, many rubs and thorns lying in the way, ſo that few work
<pb facs="tcp:58698:4"/>thro' it. Therefore the ſame Indulgence, that hath been granted to <hi>Selden, Grotius, Bochart, Marſham, F. Simons, Spencer,</hi> and Others in their Obſervations upon the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in all their <hi>Oriental</hi> Enquiries, may alſo reaſonably be expected for Monſieur <hi>Le Clerk,</hi> who often refines upon them all, and keeps within the <hi>Decorum,</hi> which a Wiſe Man would never exceed.</p>
            <p>What hath been ſaid for the <hi>Philological</hi> Part may extend to the <hi>Phyſical,</hi> in which if M. <hi>Le Clerk</hi> hath offended any nice and delicate Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity, He hath many Orthodox Predeceſſors in the ſame kind, both beyond the Seas, and in this Country, not to name any more than Biſhop <hi>Wilkins, Seth Ward, Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> the Learned Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the celebrated <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi> who Apologizes very ingeniouſly for ſo doing; but there is a ſort of Men, who cannot endure any diſſent from <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> (unleſs it be in themſelves) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſteer exactly according to the Moſaick Chart in all their Syſtems; yet ſo unfortunate are they, that they frequently run upon the ſame Sands and Rocks, where they have ſplit others; <hi>Clodius accuſat Maechum, Catilina Cethegum;</hi> and ſuch is the luck of theſe upright Authors, who very awkardly ſtrain the Phantomes of their own Brains into the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that they put all into confuſion, and had better let it reſt in Sacred Silence; the Church would do well to enjoyn ſuch Writers, not to weave their own Threds
<pb facs="tcp:58698:4"/>with thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> leaſt the old Nap ſhould be loſt, and a party-colour'd Coat appear in its room. What a monſtrous Moſaick dreſs have we in <hi>Whiſton</hi>'s <hi>Theory</hi> with a train of Comets at his Tail; in <hi>Woodward</hi>'s <hi>Eſſay</hi> with all the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains down about his Heels; in <hi>Nicholl</hi>'s <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> with multitudes of Arks, or new Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of preſerving in, or elſe creating <hi>de novo</hi> after the Flood, and with his Lyons in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Gens ratione furens, &amp; mentem paſta Chimaeris.</q>
            <p>'Tis wonderful that theſe Men ſhould venture to beat up the unenvy'd Solitudes of a <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> (who never hunts after the common prey of Dominion and Wealth, as being inconſiſtent with our Bleſſed Saviour's Kingdom) and at the ſame time expoſe themſelves to the proſecutions of every vulgar Eye; but with this difference, that he hath left <hi>Moſes</hi> pure, free, and undefiled as he found him, whereas they have polluted him with their own mixtures, and make him act what part they pleaſe, in any habit, or under any mask, as beſt ſerves their Scenes and Opera's. How ſhall the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> know their true <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo patch'd and disfigur'd with the borrowed Plumes of ſuch Birds of Paradiſe. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gave good advice againſt the vain <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of theſe Men, who corrupt the <hi>Scriptures</hi> by introducing their own Chimerical <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> into them, that
<pb facs="tcp:58698:5"/>thereby they may ſtamp them Standard, and cry down all others as Counterfeit, of baſe allay, or of falſe weight. 'Tis to be wiſh'd that this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous piece of <hi>Quackery</hi> was baniſh'd out of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> and that <hi>Apollo</hi> admoniſh'd his Subjects to treat one another in modeſt and humble Manners, avoiding the haughty Titles of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falibility;</hi> for Opinion and Probability cannot be a certain Rule, or any Foundation to domineer over one another. Monſieur <hi>Le Clerk</hi> may be allow'd to be as good an Interpreter as any <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> as great a Friend to <hi>Moſes</hi> as any <hi>Chaplain</hi> or <hi>Vertuoſo</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Deſign of theſe Diſſertations. <hi>II.</hi> That the Hebrew Tongue is no more the Primitive, than any of the other Oriental Languages. <hi>III.</hi> That the Difference of Languages aroſe from the Diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mankind. <hi>IV.</hi> That <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpoke the Chaldean Tongue. <hi>V.</hi> That Hebrew was originally the Language of the <hi>Canaanites.

VII.</hi> In what Condition it was after the Babylonian Captivity. <hi>VIII.</hi> What Care the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at that time took of the Sacred Volumes.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ALTHO' 'tis not my Intention in theſe Preliminary Diſcourſes to ramble through all thoſe common Places, which relate to the Old Teſtament in General, yet I thought it improper to put a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of this Nature into the Reader's hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any foregoing Addreſs or Ceremony. As I was frequently obliged to ſet down ſeveral
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58698:6"/>things in my Annotations for known or granted, becauſe I could not prove them there at large, without running into perpetual Digreſſions, which I always ſtudiouſly avoided; ſo I judged it <hi>à propos</hi> to handle and prove them more copiouſly in theſe Diſſertations, leaſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Reader ſhould imagine that I have all along built upon a precarious Foundation. Now the things which I barely deliver'd in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without farther Proof, may be chiefly reduced to theſe three Heads:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Hebrew Tongue.</item>
                  <item>2. The Method I follow'd in my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</item>
                  <item>3. Whether <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Pentateuch, and what end he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelf in writing.</item>

I ſhall begin with that concerning the Hebrew Tongue, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the other Points as they follow in order. But before I proceed any farther, the Reader is to be informed, that I never deſigned to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs all the Queſtions that are uſually propoſed concerning that Language, but only ſuch as are of abſolute Neceſſity towards the better underſtanding of my Commentary, which I ſhall handle juſt as they come into my Head, without confining my ſelf too Religiouſly to Method and Regularity: Therefore he is not to expect any compleat elaborate Diſcourſe at my hands, which I neither promiſe here, nor ever had it ſo much as in my Thoughts to perform.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Jews out of a Fond Affection to their own Country, and ſeveral Chriſtians who are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58698:6"/>apt to be too much influenced by them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly pretend, that the Hebrew Language was that which <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Parent of Mankind, ſpoke. The moſt plauſible Argument for which Opinion, is deduced from a few Names and Etymologies; but tho' the Maintainers of it boaſt, that they put the Matter beyond all Diſpute, yet I am inclined to believe, they are not ſo Invincible as 'tis pretended. To which purpoſe 'twill be neceſſary to hear the full Merits of the Cauſe, before we proceed to give Sentence.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In the firſt place they alledge the Name of the firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> which in the Hebrew Tongue alone alludes to the word <hi>Earth,</hi> out of which his Body was form'd, for only the Jews call the Earth <hi>Adama.</hi> This <hi>Paronomaſia</hi> or Similitude of Names, plainly appears in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> verſe 7. <hi>Et formavit Jehova Deus Adam pulverem ex Adama, hoc eſt, terrâ.</hi> The <hi>Chaldees</hi> indeed have the word <hi>Adam,</hi> but then they call the Earth <hi>Arhah,</hi> which Term has no Affinity with the name of our firſt Parent.</item>
               <item>2. For the ſame reaſon <hi>Eve</hi>'s Name <hi>Hhavah</hi> is derived from the word <hi>Hhai,</hi> Living, becauſe ſhe was the Mother of all <hi>Hhai,</hi> Living, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.20. Now this Etymology is corrupted in the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> which renders it <hi>chol bue enaſcha, of all the Sons of Men.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. So in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> v. 23. <hi>She,</hi> ſays <hi>Adam</hi> ſpeaking of his Wife, <hi>ſhall be

               <item>4. After <hi>Abel</hi> was kill'd, <hi>Seth</hi> was born to our firſt Mother, <hi>Eve,</hi> whoſe name ſhe derives from a <hi>Radix</hi> in the Hebrew Tongue, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.25. <hi>She call'd his name</hi> Scheth; <hi>For,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>God has raiſed me up,</hi> Schath, <hi>another Son in the room of</hi> Abel.</item>

            <p>Theſe and ſeveral other Names are brought by the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> to prove, as they imagine, that Hebrew is the Primitive Language; and they urge them with that Aſſurance and Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if 'twere down-right Obſtinacy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict ſo evident a Truth; but we have many weighty Reaſons on our ſide, to incline us to believe, that the Primitive Language was no more related to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> than it was either to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> or <hi>Arabick.</hi> But that the Reader may better comprehend our Meaning, we own that Opinion ſeems to be moſt probable to us, which maintains that neither <hi>Hebrew, Chaldee,</hi> nor <hi>Arabick,</hi> nor indeed any other Oriental Language, was that which <hi>Adam</hi> ſpoke, becauſe in proceſs of Time, and by the Diſperſion of Mankind, it was ſplit into ſeveral Dialects of the Eaſtern Tongues, and begot the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Languages, and ſome others nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling them. Thus, for inſtance, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Old <hi>Romans,</hi> is neither that which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58698:7"/>the <hi>Italians, French</hi> or <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſe, and yet it produced theſe three Languages, and has left ſeveral of its old Remainders in them. I know the <hi>Rabbins</hi> are of a different Opinion, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that it was preſerv'd unmixt and intire in the Family of <hi>Heber;</hi> but I ſhall ſoon demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that this is precariouſly affirm'd, and wants Reaſons to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>As for what relates to the Argument bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from the Etymology of Names, it is to be obſerv'd in the firſt place, that ſome of them are not ſo much proper Names given to the Children at their Birth, as <hi>Cognomina,</hi> or Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names by which they were known to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſo in proceſs of time paſſed for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Names. For which reaſon they might ſometimes be changed, and yet the <hi>Parono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſia</hi> of the Primitive Language be happily preſerv'd at the ſame time, as will evidently appear by the following Examples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam,</hi> as all the World knows, is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name, but beſtow'd on the firſt Man, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or by way of Pre-eminence, and ſo our firſt Father might be thus call'd by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> tho' his Contemporaries call'd him otherwiſe. Nor is the Agreement of the words, which we confeſs falls out patly enough in the Hebrew Tongue, an Argument to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for therefore Man might be call'd <hi>Adam</hi> by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> becauſe they knew the firſt Man's Body was form'd of Clay. Thus in the Latin Tongue, which I believe no Man in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58698:8"/>World ever dreamt to be the Primitive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, we might ſay that God call'd the firſt Man <hi>Homo,</hi> becauſe he was form'd <hi>ex humo, i. e.</hi> out of the Ground. Beſides the ſame thing might accidentally happen in the words <hi>Iſch</hi> and <hi>Iſchah,</hi> as amongſt the ancient Latins<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See what <hi>Fetſtus</hi> in <hi>Querquetulana virae</hi> ſays, <hi>Foeminas anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui quas nunc dicimus, Viras appellabant, unde adhuc permanent Virgines &amp; Viragines.</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> uſes this laſt word, whom herein we had no mind to imitate, becauſe <hi>Virago</hi> neither ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies what <hi>Iſcha</hi> does in Hebrew, nor <hi>Vira</hi> in Latin, but a Woman of a Maſculine Spirit.</note> 
               <hi>vir</hi> and <hi>vira</hi> were in uſe.</p>
            <p>We might here produce the frequent Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Names, even of thoſe we call Proper, but the Reader may find them in the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Annotations on <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.1. and in <hi>Huetius</hi>'s <hi>Demonſtratio Evangelica,</hi> Propoſ. 4. c. 13. §. 4. We ſhall at preſent content our ſelves to give an Inſtance or two, not taken notice of by them, of an Etymology happily expreſſed in another Language. Every one has heard of a Famous City in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which the Greeks call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which name (for 'tis of Greek Extraction) is rightly derived <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>from dirt,</hi> becauſe it was built in a dirty place. For thus <hi>Strabo</hi> in his Seventeenth Book, Page 552. of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Edition put out by <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now if the Books of the Hebrew Prophets were all loſt, Who would not Swear that this City had no other Name? Who would not believe that it was built by ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> that ſettled there, or by the Poſterity of <hi>Lagus,</hi> and bore this Greek Name ever ſince its beginning. However 'tis undeniable from <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 30.14, 15. that it was call'd <hi>Sin</hi> by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which word ſignifies <hi>dirt,</hi> as <hi>Bochart</hi> has obſerv'd, <hi>Phaleg.</hi> l. 4. c. 27.</p>
            <p>The ſame has happen'd in the name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place not far diſtant from <hi>Peluſium. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Bibliotheca</hi> mightily commends <hi>Actiſanes</hi> the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> who after he had conquer'd <hi>Ammoſes</hi> King of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and ſubdued the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, neither put the Guilty to death, nor yet wholly diſmiſs'd them unpuniſh'd, but carried multitudes of the Condemned, he thus uſed them, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <hi>Cutting off their Noſes, he tranſplanted them into the fartheſt parts of a deſart Region, and built a City, and called it from this accident</hi> Rinocolura. <hi>Strabo</hi> in his ſixteenth Book makes the ſame Remark, and ſo does <hi>Stephanus</hi> upon this word. Now thoſe Perſons that do not know, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> at this time did not ſpeak Greek, would eaſily ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded, eſpecially ſeeing it named among the Cities of

            <p>But if any one would rather deſire to ſee Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples fetch'd from the Holy Scriptures, he may obſerve how the Seventy Interpreters turn the Proper Names of the Bible into Greek, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.9. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Nay what is highly remarkable, <hi>Moſes</hi> has deriv'd the Original of his own Name from an Hebrew word, and has introduced the Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſpeaking Hebrew, who without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion expreſt her ſelf in the Egyptian Tongue, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The Child grew up, and his Nurſe brought him to the Daughter of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>who called his name</hi> Moſche; <hi>becauſe, ſaid ſhe, I drew him out of the Water,</hi> Miſhithinou. And the reaſon of it is plain, for ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw he could eaſily imitate the Egyptian Origination in the Hebrew Tongue, he made no Scruple to bring in this Princeſs, expreſſing her ſelf after that manner. But in the Egyptian Tongue he is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, <hi>taken out of the Water;</hi> for with the Old Egyptians <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>taken out.</hi> Thus in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he that was called by the Syrians <hi>Chipha</hi> or <hi>Chepha,</hi> was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Peter,</hi> by the Greeks; and ſo that <hi>Paronomaſia,</hi> which our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58698:9"/>Saviour uſed in the Hebrew or <hi>Syro-Chaldaïc,</hi> was conveniently enough tranſlated into the Greek Tongue, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.17.</p>
            <p>However I would by no means be thought to affirm, that the Name of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſuch-like, were changed: For it might ſo happen, that both the Primitives and Derivatives of the firſt Language were often preſerved in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew: But we muſt not conclude from thence, that therefore <hi>Adam</hi> ſpoke pure Hebrew. There are ſome Names, which with equal Felicity may be deduced out of the <hi>Chaldee;</hi> as for inſtance, the Name <hi>Hhavah,</hi> for <hi>Hhai</hi> ſignifies <hi>Living,</hi> no leſs in <hi>Chaldee</hi> than it does in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Nay, there are ſome Names which cannot Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally be derived from the Hebrew Roots, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Moſes</hi> deduces them from thoſe Roots, which if we ſhould urge, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> do, to ſupport the contrary Opinion, we ſhould from thence conclude, that the Hebrew Tongue has no Affinity with the Language of the <hi>Antedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians.</hi> Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And ſhe brought forth</hi> Cain, <hi>and ſaid, I have got</hi> (Kanithi) <hi>a man of the Lord.</hi> The Name <hi>Kajin,</hi> according to the common Rules, ought to be deduced from <hi>Koun,</hi> which ſignifies to Lament in <hi>Pihel;</hi> as <hi>Kajits</hi> the <hi>Summer,</hi> from <hi>Kouts;</hi> Tſaiid, <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> from <hi>Tſoud;</hi> and ſeveral more of the like nature. From the Root <hi>Kanah</hi> we ſhould more properly deduce <hi>Kanovi.</hi> Now, as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, if we were minded to copy after the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and follow their Conduct, we might
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58698:10"/>ſay, That from hence 'tis evident, that the Hebrew Tongue is not the firſt, ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> was not able to expreſs in it the Etymology of the word <hi>Kain.</hi> We might gather the ſame from <hi>Geneſis</hi> Chap. 5. v. 29. where the Father of <hi>Noah</hi> calls the Name of his Son <hi>Noahh, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he will Comfort us, Jenahhamenou,</hi> for if we are to derive the Name of this Reſtorer of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from <hi>Nahham,</hi> we ought to have called him <hi>Nohhem,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a Comforter,</hi> not <hi>Noahh,</hi> which can be deduced from nothing elſe but <hi>Noahh</hi> quievit. So that if a few happy Etymologies will prove the Antediluvian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to have been the ſame with the Hebrew, ſurely thoſe of a different Nature will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the contrary. But ſince both theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions cannot be true, what remains, but that we ſhould own that the Hebrew Language is not indeed the firſt, but the Off-ſpring of it; as are likewiſe the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> and that ſome Remainders of it are ſtill preſerved in theſe three Dialects. True it is, that the Original of the Name of <hi>Tubal Cain,</hi> which is neither to be traced out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> nor <hi>Chaldee,</hi> is plainly found in the <hi>Arabick,</hi> as we have ſhewn at the third<note n="(b)" place="bottom">'Tis worth Obſervation, ſays our Author here, that the two words, of which this name is compounded, ſignifie in the Arabian <hi>Laminam aeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Beſides
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58698:10"/>the Etymology of the word <hi>Babel</hi> is more happily deduced from the <hi>Chaldee</hi> word <hi>Bilbel confudit,</hi> than from the Hebrew <hi>Balal,</hi> which ſignifies the ſame; for there is a greater Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity between <hi>Babel</hi> and <hi>Bilbel,</hi> than between <hi>Babel</hi> and <hi>Balal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to deliver my Sentiments freely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> and ſome other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Names, many of them were not ſo much given them as Names at their Birth to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from other Men, as they are to be looked upon as Sirnames, afterwards beſtowed upon them for ſome particular Event or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that befel them. And from hence it came to paſs, as we have already ſhewn, that theſe Names were changed by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as 'tis certain ſome of them were changed by the <hi>Arabians.</hi> The firſt begotten Son of <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Cain,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, <hi>a Tiller of the Ground,</hi> which furniſh'd the <hi>Arabians</hi> with an occaſion to reckon the Lord knows who, one <hi>Habdel hharits,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Servant of a Tiller,</hi> among the Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> which rather ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Cain</hi>'s manner of Living, than another Son of our firſt Parents, as ſome People imagin'd. Concerning which Conſult, <hi>Schickard</hi> in the <hi>Prooemium</hi> to his Catalogue of the Perſian Kings. His other Son was called <hi>Hebel,</hi> that is, <hi>a fading thing that ſoon diſappears,</hi> becauſe he was kill'd by his Brother in his Youth. We know indeed that ſome Expoſitors have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd, that from a Prophetical Spirit this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58698:11"/>Name was given him at his Birth by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but a bare ſimple Conjecture can never amount to a Demonſtration. A Perſon of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Piety, and conſequently inſtructed in all the Knowledge of Divine Matters, which thoſe Times were capable of, is called <hi>Hhanoch</hi> from the Verb <hi>Hhanach,</hi> that is, <hi>docuit, inſtituit,</hi> whence the Participle <hi>Hhanouch,</hi> doctus, <hi>learned.</hi> For this reaſon the ſame Man is called by the Arabians <hi>Idris,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>learned;</hi> for <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> is <hi>accuratè &amp; ſubtiliter indagavit.</hi> His Son was called in After-ages <hi>Methouſchelahh,</hi> i. e. <hi>After his Death a breaking out,</hi> to wit, of Waters, happened. After the Flood <hi>Peleg,</hi> that is, <hi>Diviſion</hi> the Son of <hi>Heber, in whoſe days the Earth was divided,</hi> Chap. 10. v. 25. We have alſo obſerved on the<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Monſieur <hi>le Clerk</hi> here obſerves, that <hi>Nimrod</hi> is derived from the Hebrew Radix <hi>Marad,</hi> to Rebel, from whence the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick word <hi>Maridon</hi> is derived, which ſignifies <hi>Obſtinate, Proud,</hi> or <hi>Inſolent.</hi> And ſuch ſort of a Man he muſt needs be, continues our Author, who firſt diſſolved the Paternal Government, and affected a Superiority over his Brethren. I can never perſwade my ſelf, that this Name was given him as ſoon as he was born, no more than ſeveral other Names were given to others, which have a relation to their Diſpoſition, or the Inventions they found out. They rather ſeem to be their <hi>Cognomina</hi> or Sirnames, of which their Poſterity had ſome remembrance, when their Names were utterly forgotten.</note> Tenth Chapter v. 8. that <hi>Nimrod</hi> was no very honourable Title for him to whom it was given. Perhaps we might diſcover ſeveral others of the like kind, if we had a fuller and larger Hiſtory of thoſe Times. But theſe we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58698:11"/>have cited, are more than ſufficient to ſhew, that ſome of thoſe Sirnames might be changed by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore their Argument of Primitive Antiquity, deduced barely from Names, is not of that Conſequence as the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and thoſe that implicitly follow their Authority may imagine. However ſince the other reaſons that are alledged by the Jews fall infinitely ſhort of this, we lie under no Obligation to trifle away our time in confuting them, eſpecially ſince the Vanity of them has been already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the Learned <hi>Huetius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. There ſeems to have been but one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage before the Deluge: This we are ſure of, that there was but one in the Family of <hi>Noah,</hi> till the Fantaſtical Project of the Building of <hi>Babel</hi> was ſet on foot, that is to ſay, as long as they continued all in the ſame place. But after that, upon the account of ſome Differences ariſing at <hi>Babylon,</hi> Mankind was diſperſed into ſeveral Provinces of the World, and when in proceſs of time theſe diſtant Families preſerved either none, or but a ſmall Correſpondence one with another, ſeveral new Dialects ſprung up. Thus we ſee that the Latin Tongue has given birth to the Italian, Spaniſh and French Tongues, not to mention the ſeveral Dialects of each of theſe. So the Saxon Tongue alone begot the Modern German, the Dutch and Engliſh. We have<note n="*" place="margin">See this handled at large in the ſixth Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewn that the variety
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58698:12"/>of Languages did not immediately ariſe by any ſudden miraculous Impreſſion of the Divine Power; and indeed thoſe that maintain the contrary Opinion, own that there was rather a variety of Dialects, than of new Tongues.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Primitive or firſt Language has upon ſeveral accounts been changed; as for inſtance, it was turn'd by the <hi>Arabians</hi> into the <hi>Arabick,</hi> by the <hi>Chaldees</hi> it was wreſted into the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and by the <hi>Canaanites</hi> inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly changed into the <hi>Canaanean</hi> Dialect. The Jews, who fanſied it to be the Hebrew Tongue, pretend it remain'd without Change or Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in the Family of <hi>Heber,</hi> which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is no where atteſted in the Holy Scripture. Nay, on the other ſide, it ſufficiently intimates, that the Poſterity of <hi>Heber,</hi> who continued on the other ſide the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> rather ſpoke <hi>Chaldee,</hi> as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>

            <p>If we ſhould then enquire, what was the Language that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpoke on the other ſide the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> (letting bare Conjectures, or rather Rabbinical Comments alone) the moſt probable Opinion is, That he ſpoke that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which not long after was received in thoſe places, I mean the <hi>Chaldee.</hi> He lived till the ſeyentieth Year of his Life, perhaps, at <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis manifeſt beyond all Diſpute, that <hi>Chaldee</hi> was ſpoke in theſe places, in the days of <hi>Jacob</hi> the Grand-child of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for in <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.47. <hi>Laban</hi> is ſaid to have called a heap of Stones erected in remembrance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he made with <hi>Jacob, Jegar ſchaha doutha,</hi> which words are merely <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and ſignifie the <hi>Heap of Witneſs.</hi> Nor does the Language of his Grand-father <hi>Nachor</hi> ſeem to be any other than this, becauſe Languages do not uſe to change in ſo ſhort a courſe of time; for 'tis to no purpoſe to ſay that the Poſterity of <hi>Peleg</hi> preſerved the Hebrew Tongue among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſince no reaſon can be aſſigned, why <hi>Laban,</hi> who deſcended from him, as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſpoke the Chaldean Tongue, while the reſt of the Gentiles ſpoke another.

            <p>The Sacred Writers expreſly tell us, that in the following Ages, on the North and South of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> the Syrian Tongue was ſpoken, which the Jews did not underſtand; but we are no where told, that they were ignorant of the Language of their Neighbours the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites.</hi> At the ſame time I do not deny but that there may be different Dialects in one and the ſame Language, as we find by experience in all Modern Tongues, but ſtill thoſe Dialects are underſtood by all the Neighbours.</p>

It alſo appears out of <hi>Daniel, Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that the Chaldean Tongue was ſpoken at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.

            </p>
            <p>But no where do we find any like this ſaid of thoſe Nations that were ſituated between the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea</hi> and the <hi>Jordan.</hi> The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of the neighbouring People were indeed eaſie to be diſtinguiſhed from the Jewiſh Tongue, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> particularly tells us of that of <hi>Aſdod</hi> and ſome others, Chap. 13.24. but 'tis no where affirmed, that they were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Jews.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Having thus ſhewn that Hebrew was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Primitive Tongue, nor preſerved in the Family of <hi>Heber,</hi> nor yet <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Tongue, it now remains for me to enquire
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58698:15"/>where it was ſpoken: To give my own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion freely, though it is different from that of ſeveral Learned Men, who therein agree with the Jews, I ſuppoſe it was the Language of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and that the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> learnt it between the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea</hi> and the <hi>Jordan,</hi> but by no means brought it thither out of <hi>Chaldaea;</hi> neither can I diſcover after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Examination, the leaſt Abſurdity in this Opinion; for here we have a <hi>Chaldean</hi> remove himſelf with his whole Family into another Country, and having paſt the <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Jordan,</hi> wanders up and down <hi>Canaan</hi> for a hundred years, enters into Covenant with the old Inhabitants, acquires a prodigious Wealth among them, marries ſeveral Concubines, gets Children, lives in mighty Credit and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently has frequent Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with them. Now after all this, Can any one think it ſtrange, that he learnt a Language which has ſo great an Affinity with his own Mother-Tongue, and that his whole Family conform'd themſelves in their Speech to the Natives of the Place. Add to this, That <hi>Iſaac</hi> paſſed his whole, and <hi>Jacob</hi> the better part of his Life among them, that the Children of them both were brought up in the ſame Country, and had their Wives from thence. So that upon a due Survey of the matter, it had been a downright Miracle if they had ſtill preſerved the Chaldean Tongue, ſo little reaſon have we to wonder, that the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Language became familiar to theſe People.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58698:15"/>
            <p>And therefore I look upon that Opinion to be ill grounded, which ſuppoſes that the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> ſpoke a different Language from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Canaan.</hi> 'Tis certain that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> plainly calls Hebrew the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Chap. 19.18. <hi>In that day,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there ſhall be five Cities in the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>which ſhall ſpeak the lip of</hi> Canaan; which is all one as if he had ſaid, <hi>the Language of</hi> Canaan. For the word <hi>lip,</hi> both there, and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.1. ſignifies <hi>Speech,</hi> becauſe the Lips are no leſs ſerviceable in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the Tongue it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Opinion ſupported by bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, or to be called a Conjecture merely deduced from the Name, for <hi>Bochart,</hi> in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Canaan,</hi> Chap. 1. has fully demonſtrated it to be grounded upon Truth, which we ſhall lay down before the Reader in a few words, becauſe in ſome Particulars we diſſent from that admirable Man. His firſt and ſtrongeſt Argument to prove the Language of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to be the ſame with that of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is brought from the Names of Men and Places, which are purely <hi>Hebrew. N. Fuller</hi> in the fourth Book of his Miſcellanies, Chap. 4. maintains the contrary Opinion: <hi>Though I grant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>all thoſe names to be purely Hebrew, yet I deny that any of them were Canaanitiſh names, or given by thoſe People; I rather believe that the old names that were impoſed by the Canaanites, the Primitive Inhabitants of that Country, were afterwards pronounced and expounded by the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58698:16"/>Hebrews, who ſucceeded them in that Land, after the Hebrew manner.</hi> Which Hypotheſis, were it true, no Argument could be formed out of the Antediluvian Names to prove the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Hebrew Language, and yet <hi>Fuller</hi> would not willingly grant this, nor indeed any of the Patrons of this Opinion. But in truth this is no better than a Chimaera, to which the Holy Scriptures give not the leaſt Countenance; for though we ſhould allow that ſome of theſe words were diſguiſed with a Hebrew Sound and Termination, yet who can imagine that all of them were ſerved after this manner, and that neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſhould in one ſingle Line inform us, that they changed all the names, before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> poſſeſſed themſelves of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now beſides that this is altogether Incredible and without Preſident, there are two things that demonſtrate it to be abſolutely Falſe. One is, That <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> give us an account of the Alteration made in ſeveral Names, by which it appears, that this was the particular Caſe of ſome few Cities, and not common to them all. Conſult <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.2. as alſo <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.38. and <hi>Joſhua</hi> 15.13, 14. c. 19.47. The other is, That not only the names of thoſe Cities in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are of Hebrew Extraction, but alſo of the neighbouring places which they had not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, as <hi>Gaza, Aſdod, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, Hekron, Aſcalon,</hi> which belonged to the Philiſtines, <hi>Tyrus, Sidon, Barepta,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:58698:16"/>
            <p>The Second Argument to prove the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anean Original of the Hebrew Tongue is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from hence, That though the Sacred Writers expreſly tell us, that ſeveral of the neighbouring Nations were of a Language dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yet there is not the leaſt thing like this ſaid of the <hi>Canaanites:</hi> We have already taken notice that this was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerved of the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> The People of <hi>Egypt</hi> are called <hi>Lohez, Pſalm</hi> 114.1. that is to ſay <hi>Barbarous;</hi> beſides there was an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter between <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who pretended himſelf to be an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and his Brethren, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.23. likewiſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.6. In the mean time, though the <hi>Hebrews</hi> maintained ſuch frequent Correſpondences with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted ſo much Buſineſs with them from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> down to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> yet we find not the leaſt mention of an Interpreter paſſing between them.</p>
            <p>The Third Argument ariſes from the very uſe of the Interpreter whom <hi>Joſeph</hi> employed; for if only <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family ſpoke Hebrew, How was it poſſible for <hi>Joſeph</hi> to get an Interpreter? He could have no other but ſome Fugitive Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who would have ſoon known both <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Brethren.</p>
            <p>The Fourth is by <hi>Bochart,</hi> derived from the Remainders of the Phoenician Tongue, which in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Canaan,</hi> he emply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates to be purely Hebrew.</p>
            <p>We ſhall add a Fifth, which proceeds from the manifeſt Footſteps of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> that are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58698:17"/>eaſily to be traced in this Language. For ſince Tongues are Images of the Sentiments of our Mind, and are form'd and modell'd according to the Opinion of thoſe People that uſe them; it cannot otherwiſe happen, but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Speech of any Country, muſt derive a great Tincture from the received Opinions of the Inhabitants. Thus learned Criticks have obſerved, that the <hi>Arabians</hi> have more than five hundred names for a Lyon, more than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand for a Sword, two hundred at leaſt for a Serpent, and fourſcore for Honey. The reaſon of it is, becauſe the <hi>Arabians</hi> uſe frequently to talk of theſe things, ſince their Country is ſo peſter'd with Lyons and Serpents, is inhabited by a Warlike People, and abounds in Honey. 'Tis an eaſie matter to obſerve both in the Greek and Latin Tongues, though we were deſtitute of all other Arguments, which are indeed innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, that the Greeks and Latins were of Opinion, that the Gods beheld the Actions of Mankind, and were Faithful Witneſſes of the Truth, from thoſe frequent Forms of Swearing, which they uſed ſo everlaſtingly in all their Converſations.</p>
            <p>I will not give my ſelf the Trouble to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a Truth, which is ſupported by ſo many Examples, not to mention the Cuſtom of all the Modern Languages, but come immediately to the Point. The Hebrew Tongue which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and was for ſome time cultivated by the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> a People who had ſtrange Notions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58698:17"/>of the Divinity, and were infected with <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> retain'd ſeveral viſible Footſteps of thoſe Errors, even after it became the Mother-Tongue of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who had quite different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> not only believed a Plurality of Gods, but ranked ſeveral Men in the number of their Deities (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us <hi>Praep. Evang.</hi> l. 1. c. 6.) and therefore more frequently made uſe of the word <hi>Elohim,</hi> which is of the Plural Number, than the Singular <hi>Eloha</hi> God, which we ſee ſtill continued in the Hebrew Language, though they maintain'd the contrary Opinion, and were always zealous Aſſertors of one God. Hence it comes to paſs, that ſometimes they joyn a Verb in the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Number to it, purſuant to their own Notions of the Unity of God; and ſometimes in the Plural, after the manner of their Neighbours, though they only meant one God by it, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. Chap. 20.13. and our<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Monſieur <hi>le Clerk</hi> is of opinion, that the Hebrews ſpoke the ſame Language with the Inhabitants of <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> an Idolatrous People, ſo they borrowed this Faſhion of ſpeaking <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Plural Number of God from them, though purſuant to their own Opinion, of the Unity of God, they attributed only a Singular Signification to a Plural word. Therefore 'tis not to be wonder'd at, that ſometimes they joyn'd a ſingular Verb to the word <hi>Elohim,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. as having a greater regard to the Senſe of the word, than the Number of it; and at other times <hi>ratione numtri habitâ,</hi> add a plural Verb to it, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.13.</note> Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on thoſe places. 'Tis alſo obſervable, that the ſame word <hi>Elohim</hi> does not only ſignifie the Supream God, but likewiſe Angels and Magiſtrates. The reaſon of which is plain, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58698:18"/>the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> did not obſerve a ſufficient diſtinction between God, Angels and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſince ſeveral Men were reputed as Gods by them. For otherwiſe if this Language had been invented, and cultivated by a People free from Idolatry, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> afterwards were, they had neither communicated a name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Divine Nature to Creatures, nor had they uſed it plurally in their ordinary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. 'Tis certain we have nothing like this in any of the Modern <hi>European</hi> Languages, nay not in the Arabick of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who profeſs themſelves like the <hi>Europeans,</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Adverſaries to <hi>Polytheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one knows that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hated that Opinion, which ſuppoſes the Divinity to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> reſembling the Humane Nature; neither is it to be imagined, that theſe People, who were the Worſhippers of one inviſible eternal God, if they had had the inventing of their own Language, would have in their common Talk ſo much favoured the abovementioned Opinion, from which we ſee moſt Chriſtians now-a-days carefully ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain for the ſame reaſon.

               </gap> upon other Occaſions.

God, if he had ſo vouchſafed, might have declared his Will in the Indian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but this had not conferr'd the leaſt <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity</hi> upon the Indian Letters and Accents, nor ought the Indian Tongue to have been accounted leſs Holy for its Penury and Barrenneſs. Our Saviour and his Apoſtles revealed the moſt Holy Doctrines of the Goſpel in the Galilean Tongue, which was known, but deſpiſed by thoſe of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> The Apoſtles alſo preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the Gentiles in every Language, which is no leſs Holy for all that, than if they had delivered it in the ſame Tongue which <hi>Adam</hi> ſpoke, for that lies not in empty Sounds and Words, but in the Things and Thoughts. And 'tis perhaps out of Envy to them, that the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> have expreſly forbid Prayers to be ſaid in any other Language but the Hebrew, nay not excepting the Syrian. <hi>Rabbi Jochanan</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in <hi>Talmud Schab,</hi> Fol. 12.2. as 'tis gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, ſo 'tis deſervedly laught at, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Prays to have his Neceſſities relieved in the Syrian Tongue, the Miniſtring Angels do not aſſiſt him, for the Miniſtring Angels do not underſtand Syriack.</hi> 'Tis not worth the while to confute thoſe People, who believe, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> do, that this is the Language of the Angels, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58698:19"/>will be that of the Juſt after the Reſurrection Thoſe that can ſo eaſily ſwallow ſuch Stuff, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve indeed the name of great <hi>Opiniatres,</hi> but are not, I believe, much affected with ſolid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. 'Tis now high time to come to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, which no leſs diſagrees from the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binical Opinions than the former, but is of much greater uſe in the Interpretation of the Sacred Volume. 'Tis commonly boaſted by theſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyers, that the Hebrew Language is infinitely the fineſt in the World; in ſhort, they are ſo liberal in their Commendations of the Hebrew Style, that they deſpiſe all other Tongues in compariſon of that. We confeſs indeed there are ſome Beauties and Elegancies peculiar to the Hebrew Tongue, as there are to all the Tongues in the World, but at the ſame time believe it is not to be compared with others more refined and copious Languages. But before I proceed any farther, I am to inform the Reader, that it is conſider'd by us, not ſuch as perhaps it was in its flouriſhing Condition, but as we find it in the Holy Writings. I freely acknowledge that there were much more words, and a greater Variety of Phraſes uſed, than we find in this ſmall Volume; but as far as we can judge of it by its remainders, we have juſt reaſon to believe it to be a barren, ambiguous, unrefined Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which now we ſhall endeavour to prove.</p>
            <p>The Excellency of every Language conſiſts principally in three things, <hi>viz.</hi> Plenty of Words
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58698:20"/>and Phraſes, Perſpicuity of Speech, and Purity; the Rules for which are copiouſly laid down by thoſe that have treated of Rhetorick. Now 'tis certain that ſeveral Languages, but eſpecially the Greek, are much ſuperior to Hebrew in all theſe Conſiderations, and 'tis a plain Caſe, that Hebrew can with no Pretence be ſaid to be the fineſt Language in the World.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, Thoſe that attentively read over the Holy Writings, or conſult the Hebrew Lexicons, will be ſoon convinced that it has but very few Words, and very few Phraſes. There are not only the ſame words, but (what argues a miſerable Poverty) we meet with the very ſame Expreſſions every where, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Hiſtorical Books. The ſame Thread of Narration, the ſame Particularities of Style and Expreſſion are viſible all along: Nor is this only obſervable of the Writers of one Age, for all the Hiſtorians of all Times and Ages, have writ exactly after the ſame manner. I would demonſtrate this Aſſertion more at large, were not moſt Men convinced of the Evidence and Truth of it: Therefore I will dwell no longer upon ſo plain a Chapter, I will only add, That the very <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who generally omitting the true Praiſes of their Country, ſtill affect to Honour it with their Romances and Legends, are uncontrolable Witneſſes of the Poverty of their own Language, ſince for the Interpretation of the Law, they are obliged to coin innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Words for the preſent Occaſion, or elſe to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58698:20"/>ſetch them out of the Syro-Chaldaick and other Languages: And in theſe the Talmudical Books abound, and without them they could never be able to deliver or expreſs their own meaning. Every one knows that there are at leaſt ten times more words in <hi>Buxtorf</hi>'s <hi>Rabbinital The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaurus,</hi> than in his <hi>Bible-Lexicon.</hi> Nevertheleſs, with all their Foreign Aſſiſtance, this <hi>Copia Rabbinica</hi> falls infinitely ſhort of the Graecian and Latin Treaſures.</p>
            <p>If we enquire into the Cauſe of the great Sterility of the Hebrew Language, we ſhall find it to be the ſame as has been obſerved of other Languages. Where Arts and Sciences lie under Contempt, and ſew Treatiſes are written, there muſt of neceſſity be a great want of words to expreſs ſeveral things; for Men never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Names on things or the Notions of the Mind, of which they never think, diſpute, or write. For example, Before the Greeks dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently cultivated Philoſophy, there were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things of which Men never thought, and for expreſſing of which they had wanted fit words, if they had not coin'd new ones. The ſame thing befel the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to treat of Philoſophical Subjects in Latin. <hi>I call thoſe things Qualities,</hi> ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> l. 1. c. 7. Acad. quaeſt. <hi>which the Greeks call</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>which very Term among the Greeks is not uſed by the Vulgar, but only by Philoſophers, and ſeveral Inſtances there are of the like nature. The Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians too have their particular by-words which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58698:21"/>the People do not underſtand, and this Method is common to all Arts: For either new words are to be coin'd, or elſe they are to be borrow'd from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and if the Greeks follow this Conduct, who have for ſo many Ages exerciſed themſelves in theſe Affairs, How much more Lawful is it for us to do it, who but now begin to treat of them?</hi> By this Inſtance, which may be back'd with ſeveral Arts unknown to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 'tis eaſie to perceive how great a Penury of words they muſt unavoidably labour under. As they were in a particular manner ignorant in Grammar, Rhetorick, and the whole Circle of Philoſophy, as appears by their Writings, they muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be deſtitute of all thoſe great Aſſiſtances that thoſe Arts uſe to furniſh. Poetry indeed, as far as the Genius of their Language would permit, was cultivated ſomewhat better by them; ſeveral things are majeſtically and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſaid in their Songs, but yet ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince every impartial Reader, rather what they might have done, if they had uſed the ſame Application with other Nations, than what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Eloquence they had already acquired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Want of words begot Ambiguity, for when we are deſtitute of proper Terms to explain our meanings by, we muſt wreſt them into another Sence, or elſe expreſs particular things in words common to ſeveral more. <hi>For Metaphors,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> well obſerves, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>de Orat. c.</hi> 38. <hi>are like borrowing, where what a Man has not of his own, he ſupplies himſelf with elſewhere.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58698:21"/>Now if one and the ſame word ſignifies ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hings, one in its proper Acceptation, the reſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd when Particulars are called by common Names, it often happens that we do not clearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nderſtand, in what reſpect they differ from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther things of the ſame Genus. For inſtance, <hi>Erets</hi> ſignifies among the Hebrews <hi>Clay</hi> that Veſſels are made of, a <hi>Tract of Ground</hi> either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nhabit it; ſo that 'tis hard to ſay, which is its proper Signification, and which Figurative. When an univerſal Deſignation is fixed upon this word, which is expreſs'd by <hi>chol, All,</hi> 'tis doubted whether the whole Kingdom, or a leſs compaſs of Ground, or the Globe of the Earth, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Men, or only ſome, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by it; ſo that nothing but the Context, or the Nature of the thing in debate, can aſſiſt our Conjectures. When figurative Words and Phraſes cannot be ſo urged, as fully to expreſs the things they deſcribe, how far they may be urged without an Error, is often doubtful.</p>
            <p>Now if we conſider the various Significations of the indeclinable Particles, and how almoſt all the Tenſes are confounded in the Verbs, and add to this their everlaſting change of the Gender, Number and Perſon, of which ſubject abundance of Learned Men have written carefully, we ſhall have no great reaſon to boaſt of the Perſpicuity
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58698:22"/>of the Hebrew Tongue. Read but over <hi>Chr. Noldius</hi>'s Concordance of the Particles, and <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>'s <hi>Grammatica Sacra,</hi> two well approved and excellent. Treatiſes, and when that is done, I believe the moſt obſtinate Man will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that perhaps no Language in the World is fuller of Ambiguity and Obſcurity than the Hebrew.</p>
            <p>But yet I would not be ſo underſtood, as if a General Scheme of the Jewiſh Religion and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory could not be had out of the Books of the Old Teſtament; for as that is not of it ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, the chief Matters relating to it are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcated, that by virtue of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, they are made plain enough. Beſides we do not every where meet Ambiguities and Reaſons to doubt, though 'tis certain there are but too many of them. Hence it is that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belonging to the Religion or Hiſtory of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in general, has been called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, though infinite Diſputes have happened among the Learned, concerning ſome particular Circumſtances, and other abſtruſer Matters, which are never to be decided by any Light of the Underſtanding, or any Application of Mind. Our Commentary all along abounds with ſuch ſort of Queſtions, wherein we cannot pretend to ſtate Matter of Fact, but only deliver what we think our ſelves, and what others before us have conjectured; for there are infinite places ſo unaccountably perplext, that 'tis eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Impoſſibility of finding out the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58698:22"/>genuine Meaning of them, and every Perſon that has but a competent Knowledge of theſe Matters, will be ſoon ſenſible of this Truth, if he does but carefully conſider it. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thoſe Perſons that pretend to be influenced by the Truth, and not by a Party, will not eaſily condemn another for his Opinion, provided it does not hurt the Sum and Subſtance of the Book. But this is not a place to talk of theſe Matters.</p>
            <p>In the Third place this ſufficiently ſhews, that the Hebrew Language was never cultivated with any extraordinary care, for as the Culture of Ground has this end, to procure Plenty of wholſome Fruits for the Tiller, ſo are Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages for no other deſign cultivated, but that Men may have plenty or words to ſerve them upon all Occaſions, and withal a Perſpicuity of Oration, without which the greateſt Plenty is uſeleſs. For certainly the end of Speaking, is not to amuſe or tire our Hearers with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of words, but that we may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and by the Mediation of Speech, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey our Thoughts into the Minds of others.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Hebrews</hi> not only neglected Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and thoſe other Arts and Diſciplines that help to enrich a Language in words, but were utterly unacquainted with Rhetorick that ſerves to refine them. Upon this account they every where trample upon the Rules of the <hi>Rhetors,</hi> even thoſe that do not depend upon the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wills of Men, but are built upon the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58698:23"/>Rules of Reaſon, and ought to have the ſame Authority all the World over. No body doubts but that Clearneſs is one of the greateſt Happineſſes any Tongue can boaſt of, ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Miſtakes may ariſe from words not rightly underſtood, which are not only trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the common Offices of Life, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly dangerous in Matters of greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as we find, never took any great Pains to render their Language Perſpicuous.</p>
            <p>If 'tis not, it ought at leaſt to be a Matter of Commendation among all People, neither to uſe fewer words than are neceſſary to make a Man underſtood, nor more than are requiſite, eſpecially in a ſimple Narration, that ſo our Hearers may fully comprehend our meaning. <hi>A Narration,</hi> ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> who was not only an admirable Orator, but a great Maſter of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>lib</hi> 1. <hi>de Inv. cap.</hi> 20. <hi>ought to have three Qualifications. it ought to be Conciſe, Clear, and Probable.</hi> We ſhall not meddle with the two laſt, as having already treated of Perſpicuity, and becauſe a Diſpute about Probability is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent here, but let us ſee what he ſays of Brevity. <hi>'Twill be ſhort,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if we begin no higher than the preſent occaſion demands, and do not ramble into far-fetch'd Stories; and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a thing in General, without mentioning every little Particular; for, generally ſpeaking, 'tis enough to ſay ſuch a thing was done, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into the Circumſtances, and if we proceed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58698:23"/>no farther in the Story than things are worth knowing: And if we do not make Digreſſions into Foreign Matters: And if we ſo ſpeak, that from what is already ſaid, the Reader may ſometimes gueſs at what is not ſaid: And if we not only omit whatever is deſtructive of Perſpicuity, but alſo whatever neither hinders nor helps it: And if every thing is only told once, and if we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with that where we left off laſt.</hi> Though theſe Rules are agreeable to Reaſon, yet the Jews neglected them, as might be proved by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inſtances if there was occaſion for it, which the attentive Reader will eaſily diſcover in our Annotations. Unleſs we carry this along with us, while we ſtrive to accommodate the Hebrew Hiſtories to the Precepts of Rhetorick, we ſpoil all, and do not underſtand what they mean. They are frequently defective in what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and abound in Superfluities; both which, unleſs they are ſupplied, or elſe are known to be redundant, 'tis impoſſible to underſtand them. An Emphaſis is urged where there is none at all, and when any thing is omitted in a Narration, though 'tis by no means Rhetorical, that they'll tell you, againſt all Senſe and Reaſon, ought not to be underſtood. Hence ariſe thoſe angry Wars between the Interpreters, and bold Decrees paſs concerning the Sence of ſome ambiguous places, which 'tis a mortal Sin to endeavour afterwards to revoke. Hence proceed Anger and Hatred, and all thoſe Miſchiefs which Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Quarrels uſually draw after them.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58698:24"/>
            <p>There is another Rule likewiſe which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently neglected in the Narrations of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, and yet is not undeſervedly commended by the Skillful in Rhetorick. As we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen, they not only adviſe us to make the Narration as clear as we can, but alſo Methodical and Open, <hi>That what is firſt tranſacted be firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and the Series of Things and Times ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Matters be told exactly as they were done.</hi> How Religiouſly the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd this Rule, let only the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for them, the good Order of which Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory will raiſe a thouſand inſuperable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if we do not remember that the Jews were no Slaves to the Regularities of Time and Action. Thus what is ſaid concerning the Diſperſion of the Nations in the tenth Chapter, ought to be placed after the ninth Verſe of the eleventh Chapter. The third, fourth, fifth and eighth Verſes of the eleventh Chapter are likewiſe Inverſions of the Narrations, as alſo the 23d Verſe of the 24th Chapter. See the Notes on Chap. 20.2. Chap. 36.6. Chap. 34.1. and what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd in the Chronological Tables on this place.</p>
            <p>If from theſe Obſervations that reſpect intire Sentences, and the due ordering of them, we paſs to ſingle Words and ſingle Locutions, we ſhall find the Precepts of Rhetorick no leſs neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected there. But at preſent we will only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves to produce two or three Inſtances of words uſed in a Figurative Sence. And here,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58698:24"/>as the Rhetoricians tell us, <hi>All Diſparity is to be avoided,</hi> becauſe every Metaphor is, or ought to be, grounded upon ſome likeneſs. Upon which Score neither the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor the <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> inſtead of <hi>to occaſion a Dearth,</hi> durſt have ſaid <hi>to break the Staff of Bread.</hi> Which Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being not rightly underſtood, has made very Learned Men fall into ſtrange Miſtakes, as we ſhall ſhew in a proper place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe,</hi> as the Maſters of Eloquence obſerve, <hi>the chief Excellence of a word figuratively applied, conſiſts in making a greater Impreſſion upon the Senſe; therefore all groſs ſordid Images are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided, that may nauſeate the Hearer.</hi> Therefore by this Rule it was not lawful to ſay, That <hi>God was a War-like Man,</hi> That <hi>he was rouſed up like a Sleeper,</hi> and <hi>like a valiant Man, who after he has ſlept out his Wine, cries aloud.</hi> And ſeveral other Expreſſions of the like nature.</p>
            <p>I will inſtance in no more, for theſe are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince the moſt prejudiced Reader, that the Hebrew Language is extreamly Rude and Impolite. But before I diſmiſs this Article, I muſt inform him of two things, and then take my Farewel of it. The Firſt is, That we by no means pretend to deny, that the Hebrew Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are here and there imbelliſh'd with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sentences, and that there are many ſublime Paſſages, but eſpecially among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But this is not enough to give a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the Denomination of Polite, ſince no Tongue in the World can arrive to a ſufficient
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58698:25"/>Perfection of Purity, without a long and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Application to Grammar and Rhetorick for ſome Ages at leaſt. A Book ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from the beginning to the end of it, all or moſt of the Rules of Elocution and Order, to make it paſs for an elegant and regular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Ep.</hi> 13. <hi>Even the</hi> Barbarians <hi>now and then invent finely, and diſcourſe magnificently, but none but learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can diſpoſe things fitly, and paint them with an agreeable Variety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other is, That whatever has been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaid by us concerning the Hebrew Tongue, has only a relation to the Words and Stile, as the People commonly uſed them, but not to the things themſelves that were revealed by God to the Jewiſh Prophet, and by them communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the World. No ſound Chriſtian ever denied that theſe things were always of the greateſt Moment, and ſometimes to be above the reach of Humane Underſtanding. But though God Almighty diſcover'd them to us by the Jews, yet he permitted them to uſe ſuch a Stile as was moſt Familiar to themſelves and their own Country-men: For the Spirit, by which they were influenced, by a wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, accommodated himſelf to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Cuſtoms of their Language. Hence it comes to paſs, that the Apoſtles deliver'd the Doctrine of Chriſt not in an Attick Stile, or with <hi>Plato</hi>'s Eloquence, but after their own way ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the People, for though they were Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58698:25"/>inſpir'd, yet they were but indifferently skill'd in Humane Learning, as we are told by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1. and elſewhere. And herein the Divine Wiſdom manifeſtly appears, that theſe Heavenly Truths ſhould be reveal'd to, and, for ſeveral Ages, preſerved by a Barbarous unlearned People, as the Greeks called them, and yet not the leaſt tittle of them be known to thoſe Nations that were in full Poſſeſſion of all Arts and Sciences. That this was not done raſhly, but purſuant to the Will of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But this <hi>en paſſant,</hi> leaſt any Cenſorious Reader ſhould imagine, that we confound Divine and Humane things together; but to carry on this Argument as it deſerves, would take up a greater ſpace than the narrow limits of this Diſſertation will allow.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. As long as the Jewiſh Government ſtood, and the People kept unmixt from other Nations, we may probably ſuppoſe they preſerv'd the Strength and Purity of their Language; ſo that from <hi>Moſes</hi> down to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> it receiv'd no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Alterations. For while they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd with the Manners of their Neighbours, conſequently they made no change in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; by which means their Language might have been extreamly alter'd, even whilſt it was inrich'd and poliſh'd, which we know was the Fate of the Latin Tongue.

            <p>But after that the Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> as well as the other Ten, were carried into Captivity, and thoſe that went not beyond the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> were ſcatter'd up and down the Neighbourhood, among Nations that ſpoke dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Dialects of the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Tongue: When the Jews, I ſay, after Seventy years, return'd into <hi>Judea</hi> at laſt out of ſeveral Countries, their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage could not avoid being vitiated with a mixture of other Dialects. <hi>At that time,</hi> ſays <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 13.23. <hi>I ſaw Jews, that took to them Wives from</hi> Aſdod, Hammon <hi>and</hi> Moab, and their Children ſpoke one half <hi>(Hhatſi)</hi> in the Speech of <hi>Aſdod,</hi> and knew not <hi>to ſpeak</hi> pure <hi>Hebrew: And thus they ſpoke after the Tongues of ſeveral People: Nehemiah</hi> indeed expreſly tells us, he prohibited ſuch Marriages, but 'twas not in his power to hinder the Jewiſh Language from being corrupted by that mixture: Nay, thoſe that came from <hi>Chaldaea</hi> no leſs intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>Chaldaiſms.</hi> In following Ages, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite numbers of Jews not only lived in <hi>Judea,</hi> but in the neighbouring Nations, as <hi>Syria, Egypt,</hi> nay, and in remoter places, and yearly viſited <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon the Score of their Religion, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that not only thoſe that lived out of <hi>Judea,</hi> but even the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that daily convers'd with theſe Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and married among them, muſt ſtrangely adulterate their Language. So that at laſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the true genuine Hebraiſm, there ſprung a <hi>Syro-Chaldean</hi> Mixture, as appears by the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58698:26"/>words of that Language that are to be found in the New Teſtament, not to mention now the Dialect of the <hi>Talmud.</hi>

            <p>As other Writers have demonſtrated theſe Matters more copiouſly, and a <hi>detail</hi> of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars is not our buſineſs here, I will only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that within ſome Ages after their return from the Captivity, the old Hebrew, as we find it in the Sacred Writings, was no longer the Mother-Tongue of the Jews, and therefore thoſe that had a mind to be Maſters of it, were obliged to ſtudy and peruſe the Holy Volumes. Now though they had no more Hebrew Books than we have at preſent, yet in this matter they were much Happier than we, becauſe the Tongue they ſpoke, had ſo great an Affinity with the ancient Hebrew, and therefore was no ſmall help towards the attaining it. For this reaſon we find, that the Seventy Interpreters have<note n="(f)" place="bottom">I ſhall give two Inſtances of it. They have tranſlated <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Rakiah,</hi>

            <p>But now if we conſider the lamentable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Jewiſh Republick, on every ſide
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58698:27"/>oppreſs'd, and over-run by the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> for many years, we ſhall find they had no opportunity to apply themſelves to the Study of Grammar: And indeed ſome Learned Men, after a careful Examination of the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint Verſion, which was publiſh'd in thoſe times, have long ago concluded that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had any certain fixt Grammar, or Gloſſary, or Lexicon of the Hebrew Tongue: For they frequently violate all the Laws of Grammar, and in the tranſlating of unuſual words, the meaning of which is not to be gather'd from the Context, they are ſo ſtrangely put to it, that it plainly appears they were not led by Grammar Rules, had no certain Knowledge of the true Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of words but gueſs'd and conjectur'd as well as they could, and ſo blunder'd right or wrong through all the difficult places. I am not ignorant that <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> and ſome other Perſons, who never gave themſelves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ſuppoſe, to compare it with the Hebrew Original, endeavour to defend this Tranſlation, and ſay 'tis in many places corrupted by the Negligence or Boldneſs of the Tranſcribers, where there's an evident Miſtake in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating a Hebrew Word. But thoſe that exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this Verſion diligently, will ſoon perceive the contrary; nor indeed is it credible, that it was every where almoſt corrupted in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure places, to omit a hundred other things that may be ſaid againſt ſo precarious an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:58698:27"/>
            <p>In thoſe, and the following Ages, down to the time of the<note n="*" place="margin">A.D 494.</note> 
               <hi>Maſorites,</hi> though Jews ſeem wholly to have employed themſelves in the Study of Allegories and Rites, but not of Philological Learning; which was the reaſon that they look'd upon this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is far from being perfect, not only as the moſt exact thing of that nature in the whole World, but as Divinely Inſpir'd. See the Hiſtory of <hi>Ariſteus, Philo</hi> in his Book <hi>de Vitâ Moſis,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus Jud. Ant.</hi> l. 12. c. 2. No ſurer an Argument can be given, how far the old Hebrew was neglected in thoſe times, than their blind Admiration of theſe Interpreters, who (to ſpeak impartially) are rather to be pardon'd, than commended for their Performance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we do not ſay this, as if we thought that Tranſlation to be of little uſe. On the other hand, we always believed it to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Serviceable, provided we help the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracy and defect of Method in the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with Grammar Rules, and the aſſiſtance of correct Lexicons. As their Authority ought not to over-weigh Grammar-Reaſons, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the immemorial Cuſtom of any Tongue; ſo where Grammar does not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and where the Sence allows, it ought to be in great Eſteem with us. The Opinions of that Age, which aroſe perhaps from ſome ancient Tradition, nay, even Conjectures that are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the uſe of the <hi>Syro Chaldaïc</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, then in its flouriſhing Condition, are by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58698:28"/>no means to be diſ-regarded by ſuch as are well skill'd in the Sacred Philology.</p>
            <p>But as in thoſe things they are much ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to us, ſo we mightily exceed them in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; for ſince we have moſt accurate Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars, and follow fixt eſtabliſh'd Rules, we no longer unriddle the Conſtruction of a Sentence by gueſſing, nor are we carried up and down by uncertain Conjectures, as we may obſerve the Ancients were. We have likewiſe ſeveral Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons compiled, from all places of Scriptures compared together, by moſt Learned Men, and Concordances wherein are all the words in the Bible, and the places where they are to be found, moſt accurately ſet forth; by which Aſſiſtances we are now able more certainly to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cover the various Signification of words, and with more Reaſon to defend them. Nor have we only very large Gloſſaries of the Hebrew Tongue, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the neighbouring Languages, as <hi>Chaldee, Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> and out of theſe can we more conveniently compare theſe Tongues with one another, than thoſe that lived in the days of the Seventy Interpreters.</p>
            <p>Of what prodigious Advantage a certain Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, made up of immutable Rules, is, may for inſtance ſake be ſoon known from the Latin and Greek Tongues. In <hi>Cicero</hi>'s time the Greek Tongue flouriſh'd in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> he not only learnt it at <hi>Rome,</hi> but in <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf, and both writ and ſpoke Greek not amiſs. Who would believe now, that in any of his Tranſlations out
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58698:28"/>of Greek, any Paſſages could drop from him that are liable to Cenſure? Yet for all this, ſome Learned Men have diſcovered ſeveral Miſtakes in him, and the reaſon is, becauſe he acquired the Greek Tongue rather by Cuſtom than Rules; for which conſult <hi>H. Stephens</hi>'s <hi>Lexicon Cicero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianum.</hi> Nay what is more, do not we ſee that <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> the moſt Learned of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> have committed ſuch miſerable Miſtakes, even in the Derivations of the Latin Tongue, that we are aſhamed of them? For though the Latin was their Mother-Tongue, and they daily took pains to learn Greek, yet they were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ignorant of the Etymologick Art, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed unaccountable Errors. The caſe of the LXX Interpreters is the ſame, for being wholly Strangers to our Grammatical and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical way of Interpretation, they often miſtake, and unexpectedly fall into thoſe Errors, which we may eaſily avoid.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If what I have advanced concerning Philological Learning being little minded by the Jews under the ſecond Temple be true, as it evidently appears by what has been already ſaid, and might be made out by many more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we may probably ſuſpect that the Holy Volumes were not always tranſcribed with that Exactneſs and Care by the Copyiſts then, as they deſerved. 'Tis certain the LXX Interpreters, whoever they were, which 'tis not our buſineſs now to enquire, ſeem to have made uſe of a very faulty Manuſcript, and ſometimes were not able
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58698:29"/>to gueſs the <hi>ductus literarum,</hi> as Learned Men have long ago obſerved. I own indeed, that all the various Lections, which may be collected in their Tranſlation, are not owing to a vitious Manuſcript, and that ſeveral of them perhaps ought to be imputed to their Conjectures.

            <p>Beſides we find that the Book which the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorites</hi> made uſe of, and was of venerable Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity without queſtion, has frequently faults in the<note n="*" place="margin">Text.</note>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Finalis,</hi> which is to be found in the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> is often omitted in the word <hi>Naharah, a Girl,</hi> which ought not to be left out; and <hi>hi</hi> is frequently read for <hi>hou,</hi> which (generally ſpeaking) is amended in the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Book. 'Tis true, theſe and ſome others of the like nature, are but ſmall inconſiderable Miſtakes,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58698:29"/>however they ſhew that Miſtakes might creep in, and indeed did creep into the Text, and if they did it in a word ſo common and eaſie as <hi>Naharah,</hi> certainly they would much ſooner do ſo in an obſcure, difficult, and rare word, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the Sence was abrupt, and the Series of the Oration did not help out the Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who did not underſtand it.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, becauſe the Books of the Law were more frequently read than any of the reſt, and are more eaſie to be underſtood, I muſt own there were but few Faults in them, and thoſe of ſmall Importance: And moreover that our Copy, I mean that of the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> ſeems to be more Correct than the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> for which reaſon I have all along Faithfully ſet it down, not ſo much as changing a Letter. As I hinted above, ſome Faults are left by the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> which might have been amended, but 'tis better, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that thoſe very Faults ſhould be left in the Copy, than that it ſhould ſmell too much of a Critical hand, which I have often obſerved in the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> though it is not without its Faults, as Learned Men have long ſince taken notice.</p>
            <p>After all, to deliver my own Sentiments, upon a ſerious Examination of the whole Matter, I am clearly of opinion that no Books of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, have arrived to our hands ſo correct as are the Holy Writings of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> although 'tis certain they are much the oldeſt of any; I mean thoſe that were copied out by the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> and ſo tranſmitted to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58698:30"/>Poſterity. And that this did not happen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a particular Providence, which has hitherto ſo miraculouſly preſerved the Sacred Hiſtories, and the Revelations of the Prophets, for the common Benefit and Uſe of Mankind, no Man is better ſatisfied than my ſelf. I have likewiſe frequently in this Book defended the common Readings againſt the Conjectures of Learned Men; as any one may ſee that will peruſe my Annotations. At the ſame time I freely own, that the moſt indefatigable and judicious <hi>Lud. Cappel,</hi> has infinitely deſerved of the Sacred Learning, by his <hi>Critica Sacra,</hi> and <hi>Arcanum Punctuationis.</hi> To ſpeak ingenuouſly, moſt of his Opinions do extreamly pleaſe me, and I have ſet them down as if they had been ſo many Demonſtrations. But ſince I was obliged to chuſe one certain Edition to follow, and that the moſt accurate, I have only followed the Maſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritick Copy in my Tranſlation, as being the moſt correct of all, and yet I have not neglected to ſet down in my Commentary, all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lections out of the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and the Ancient Interpreters, that ſeem'd to be of any Moment.

            </argument>
            <p>SINCE after the Labours of ſo many Learned Men, who both in this, and eſpecially the laſt Age, have endeavoured to Interpret the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58698:31"/>Holy Scriptures, 'tis my Lot alſo to undertake the ſame Province; I think it but neceſſary to acquaint the Reader upon what Motives I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, and after what manner I have perform'd it. I am ſenſible that I have engaged not only in a very difficult, but a moſt invidious Affair, by reaſon of the different Parties and Factions that diſturb the Repoſe of the Chriſtian World. For in a Buſineſs of this nature, if a Man does not do ſomething ſingular to diſtinguiſh him from the reſt, he muſt expect to meet with the Contempt and Laughter of the Learned and Unlearned, and if he advances any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of, and untouch'd before, (which I dare preſume to ſay is no eaſie matter) for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe he's ſure to incurr the Hatred and Malice of the World, eſpecially as 'tis manag'd by the Divines now a-days. Nevertheleſs after I had ſeriouſly revolv'd all this in my Mind, I was at laſt determin'd by the Authority of <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> who after he has commended the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Volumes of <hi>Moſes</hi> as they deſerve, and ſhown what a Fatigue and Trouble his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters muſt expect, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſays he, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Yet we muſt not therefore deſiſt, but for the ſake of Piety, ſtrive to ſay ſomething above our Power, and advance as far as 'tis lawful for Humane Minds to aſpire, that are poſſeſs'd with the Love and deſire of Wiſdom.</hi> In the beginning of his Book <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Having therefore with God's Aſſiſtance, as I hope, undertaken this difficult Affair, I have all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58698:31"/>along endeavour'd neither to diſguſt the Nice Reader with any nauſeous Repetitions, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige the Lovers of Antiquity with any new Doctrines. After what manner I have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd it, I deſign to lay open in this Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as plainly as I can; but firſt of all I ſhall ſhew with what Difficulties I ſtruggled, and by what means I was able to overcome them, and in this Age particularly better than could be done in the laſt; not that we pretend to a greater ſhare of Judgment, but becauſe we have much better helps now to enable us to ſurmount them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Before we come to the Interpretation of the Holy Books, 'twill be neceſſary to remind the Reader as briefly as we can, what is meant by the word <hi>Interpret,</hi> for we do not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deliver all the Rules of that Art. Now ſince they that ſpeak, make uſe of certain Words or Forms of Speaking, in order to be underſtood by others, and to raiſe the ſame Motions and Affections of the Mind in their Hearers as they feel themſelves, thoſe may be ſaid to interpret other Mens words, (if we take the word in a large Acceptation) whoſo expreſs them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue, that they who hear the Interpreter ſpeak, think altogether the ſame things, in the very ſame order and manner, as the Perſon that ſpoke firſt would have them. If all Languages were equally Copious, and furniſh'd with words of the ſame Force and Energy, we might ſafely then render Word for Word, and Phraſe for Phraſe, and conſequently we ſhould only have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58698:32"/>occaſion for a literal ſimple Tranſlation. But ſince Languages do not anſwer one another ſo exactly, 'tis impoſſible to make a Verbal Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation if the Narration is ſomewhat long. Many things muſt of neceſſity be explain'd in ſewer or more words, as the occaſion demands, if the Interpreter has a mind to be underſtood, and to gain that Point in the Minds of his Hearers, as he whoſe Interpreter he is deſires he ſhould. Nay ſometimes though we increaſe or diminiſh the number of words, yet the ſame Notion cannot be expreſs'd in two Languages, by reaſon of the Diverſity of the Idiom. An infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Words and Expreſſions, whether Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or proper, are ſo peculiar to their own Tongues, that they can by no means be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into another, without a long and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Circumlocution, which cannot be inſerted into a Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>From hence 'tis eaſie to conclude, That no Tranſlation can be in all Reſpects compleat, that is to ſay, ſuch a Tranſlation, that after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing of it, the Reader ſhall think the very ſame things, and be affected after the ſame manner, as if he underſtood the Language out of which the Verſion was made, and was able to draw for himſelf out of the Original Fountain. And as this holds certainly true in all Languages in the World, ſo 'tis moſt ſenſibly perceiv'd in the Latin Tranſlations of the Hebrew Books, by reaſon of the vaſt Diſagreement between the Hebrew and Latin Tongues, as we ſhall more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58698:32"/>fully demonſtrate below. We know indeed that the ancient Jews and Chriſtians, who were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Hebrew Tongue, thought the Greek Verſion of the Old Teſtament, but eſpecially that of the Pentateuch, commonly ſaid to be done by the LXX Interpreters, to be the moſt abſolute thing in its kind that ever was, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Whether the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans learn the Greek Tongue, or the Greeks the Chaldean Tongue, and light upon both Scriptures, the Chaldean, and that into which it is tranſlated, they admire and adore them as Siſters, or rather as one and the ſame both in words and things; not content to call them Interpreters, but Prophets, and Revealers of heavenly things, that happily expreſſed the genuine Thoughts of</hi> Moſes <hi>with a moſt pure Spirit.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Philo</hi>'s words in his Book <hi>de Vitâ Moſis,</hi> which we could heartily wiſh were as true as they are remote from Truth. We ſhould then have the beſt and ſureſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the exemplar of a perfect Tranſlation, which they were very far from obliging the World with.</p>
            <p>But ſince 'tis evident that, what <hi>Philo</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends was done by the LXX Interpreters, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be performed, by reaſon of the great difference of Languages, as it has been already obſerved, we did not therefore attempt to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the Old Teſtament, becauſe we hoped that thoſe who were only well skill'd in Latin, might be able, after the reading of our Tranſlation, to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58698:33"/>reach the meaning of the Prophets, as well as thoſe that underſtand Hebrew, and hear them ſpeak in their own Native Tongue; we thought 'twas enough to aſpire towards it, as far as the moſt different Idioms of the two Languages would give us leave; and ſince without taking too great a liberty, we could not bend the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Phraſe to the Genius of the Latin Tongue, we often expreſs'd the Hebraiſms Word for Word, eſpecially ſuch as the Chriſtian World has been long accuſtom'd to, or whenever we did not certainly underſtand the meaning of any place. Of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Hebrew Phraſes, and manner of Expreſſion, being different from all others, would give a great deal of Trouble to thoſe that are only acquainted with Latin, we have added a plain Paraphraſe more ſuited to the nature of that Tongue; by the reading of which, if they cannot attain to the very words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet ſince we have in the ſame order expreſs'd that in Latin, which <hi>Moſes</hi> did in Hebrew, they will in ſome meaſure comprehend his Senſe, and not as I imagine, deviate much from the true meaning of the Text. By this means what we were not able to compaſs by one ſingle Verſion, perhaps we may perform by the help of the Paraphraſe.</p>
            <p>But after all, we thought we ſhould not fully ſatisfie the Curioſity, if not of the moſt Learned, yet of thoſe who were not altogether Strangers to Hebrew, if we did not in our Annotations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Hebraiſms, Opinions, Cuſtoms, Rites,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58698:33"/>the Alluſions to them, and the nature of places, as far as we could arrive to the Knowledge of them, and give an account of our whole Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation and Paraphraſe. Thus in our Paraphraſe we have in a few words ſhewn what our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was; and in our Annotations more at large why we were of that Opinion: Nevertheleſs there is ſomething in the Paraphraſe, which is not always to be found in our Annotations; for in the former, the Reader will diſcover the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and Series of the whole Oration, which for brevity ſake we could not always attend in our Comments. Beſides we have obſerv'd both by our own and the Experience of others, that eſpecially in difficult Books, notwithſtanding the Annotations of Learned Men upon every word, the Connexion was very often obſcure, ſo that though all the words were well enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, yet the Force and Order of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning did not appear. Therefore we thought our ſelves obliged to obviate this Inconvenience by making a continued Paraphraſe, after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſeveral judicious<note n="*" place="margin">As the Learned Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhers of the Books <hi>in uſum Delphini</hi> have generally done.</note> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. Which Conduct, if it does not ſeem altogether ſo neceſſary in Hiſtorical Writings, as ſome who have not duly conſider'd the Matter may imagine; yet the great Uſefulneſs of it will at leaſt appear in the <hi>Hagiographi</hi> as they are call'd, and the Books of the Prophets. However I dare without Vanity affirm, that ſeveral, who after they have read the Tranſlation, think they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58698:34"/>underſtand the Series of the Oration well enough, will, if they caſt their Eyes on our Paraphraſe, even in the Hiſtorical Books, confeſs that they miſs'd ſeveral things, which they fanſied they underſtood very well. But I had rather the Reader ſhould be convinced of this Truth, by the peruſal of our Work, than by our own Boaſting.</p>
            <p>In our Annotations we have only endeavoured to open and illuſtrate that which is called the <hi>Grammatical,</hi> and by the School-men the <hi>Literal</hi> Sence. We have there laid down no Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical or Theoretical, no Moral or Practical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, as well becauſe it would have too much ſwell'd the bulk of the Work, as becauſe after the Grammatical Sence is once fully underſtood, 'tis the eaſieſt matter in the World to find out the Theoretical or Practical Doctrines, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe that have read any Syſtems of Divinity or Morality. We have alſo meddled with no Theological Controverſies, becauſe it was not our Intention to gratifie this or that Party, but (what all good Chriſtians ought to agree in) the lovers of the Holy Scriptures and of the Truth. As for thoſe Perſons that take a delight to know theſe Squabbles, which it were better for the Intereſt of Mankind that they were extinguiſh'd, they may have Books and Comments more than enough, written merely to gratifie a Faction, and theſe they may turn over at their leiſure.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome People will cenſure me, that I have not handled every thing more <hi>like a Divine,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:58698:34"/>but let them know, whoever they be, that I purpoſely left that Province, to be manag'd by their ſublimer Wits. We might indeed be juſtly blamed, if we omitted any thing we promiſed to perform, but ſince it was never in our Thoughts, as we have ſolemnly affirm'd, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail Theological Dogma's, it would be hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to condemn us for what we never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. Nay, they have our leave to deſpiſe theſe our Performances in compariſon of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical and abſtruſer Contemplations. We'll not diſown, if they pleaſe, that we did not penetrate into the obſcure meaning of the Holy Writers, that lurks under the <hi>Cortex Grammaticus.</hi> Let us be thought to underſtand no more in the Sacred Books of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> than <hi>the Authors were willing the People ſhould underſtand,</hi> which <hi>Antonius</hi> in <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Learning, frankly owns of himſelf. If we have been able to attain but to this ſmall Pittance every where, we ſhall mightily congratulate our ſelves, and others of vulgar Underſtanding, to whoſe Apprehenſion this was ſuited.</p>
            <p>But as we had often occaſion to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Conjectures were right, and could not make out the meaning clear enough by the help of Grammar and Criticiſm alone, or elſe ſeveral meanings of equal Probability offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: The Reader may obſerve, that both in our Paraphraſe and Commentary, we uſe a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and no Dogmatical Stile, and perhaps he will there diſcover frequenter Reaſons for ſuſpending
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58698:35"/>his Opinion, than in moſt Writings of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But ſince every Man Believes and Doubts for himſelf, I muſt inform thoſe Learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that have a greater inſight in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I writ for my ſelf, and ſuch as ſtand upon the ſame level, and may they hug them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſweet Contemplation, that they know more than their Neighbours. Leaſt we ſhould betray any one into Miſtakes, we made a ſcruple to aſſert ſome things poſitively, when neither by the aſſiſtance of others, nor by our own Endeavours, we were able to fix any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Judgment: However it does not follow, that People do not invent, becauſe they do not affirm. As we vaſtly diſagree from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe Perſons, who believe that nothing can be made out in Scripture, with the help of Grammar alone, unleſs Tradition comes in for a ſhare; ſo we do not believe that it can explain and clear every thing: We are ſure we have found it ſo. Now where the matter was not evident beyond all poſſibility of Diſpute, we have taken care to reſtrain all raſh Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which would be an unpardonable Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on the World, if we ſhould affirm things falſe, or things unknown; beſides that, nothing can be more Scandalous, than to let our Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation run before our Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="3">III. So much we thought our ſelves oblig'd to ſay, concerning our Manner of Interpreting in general, now we ſhall proceed to lay before our Reader the Difficulties that gave us no little
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58698:35"/>Pain, when we firſt began to ſet Pen to Paper. If we rendred word for word, it was apparent that the Verſion would become unſerviceable to thoſe that were unacquainted with Hebrew, for whoſe uſe it was principally intended: For it had been utterly impoſſible for them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, unleſs they perpetually conſulted the Comments, where nevertheleſs many Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Criticiſms of ſmall importance are omitted: And frequently too, thoſe that are unskillful in Hebraiſms, would have wreſted them in a wrong Sence. And now, if to avoid theſe Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, we had follow'd a different Conduct, allowing our ſelves too great a Latitude; it was to be fear'd, leſt in obſcure places we might impoſe our own Conjectures upon the Reader, inſtead of the meaning of the Sacred Writers. I know 'twill be replied to all this, That a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way is then to be obſerv'd, whereby the Tranſlation ſhall neither be made ſo ſervile and cloſe as to become obſcure, and mis-lead thoſe that are only skill'd in Latin, nor too lax or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant, ſo as to ſhew the Interpreter rather than the Writer himſelf. But ſo ſevere an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is much harder to be well perform'd, than 'tis eaſie to talk of it, as we ſhall ſhew by a few Examples.</p>
            <p>'Tis a frequent Hebraiſm, <hi>And he lift up his Eyes and ſaw: Et ſuſtulit oculos, &amp; vidit.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.10. &amp; 18.2. &amp; 22.4, 13. &amp; 24.62. &amp; 31.10, 12. &amp; 37.25. &amp; 39.7. &amp; 43.28. This Phraſe with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as it appears by the above-mentioned
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58698:36"/>places, ſignifies to look round about one, to ſee things at hand, and remote, and the like. We frequently meet with it in the other Books of the Old Teſtament in the ſame Sence; ſo that there is no room left to doubt of its Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now the <hi>Latins</hi> have the ſame Phraſe, but then 'tis in a different meaning. Thoſe that are afraid and aſhamed, we uſe to ſay, dare not <hi>oculos attollere;</hi> and on the other hand, thoſe People, <hi>tollunt oculos,</hi> that are poſſeſs'd with no Apprehenſions, as it were eaſie to prove by ſeveral Inſtances. Therefore this Hebraiſm <hi>we ſaw,</hi> was not to be verbally tranſlated.</p>
            <p>There is a like Expreſſion, Chap. 29.1. <hi>Et ſuſtulit Jacobus pedes. And</hi> Jacob <hi>lift up his feet, and went into the Eaſtern Country.</hi> Now who could make any thing of <hi>tollere pedes?</hi> The <hi>Latins</hi> indeed ſay, <hi>Efferre, inferre, ferre pedem,</hi> but in another Senſe.</p>
            <p>The Reader muſt be forc'd to own, that theſe Hebraiſms were ſo to be rendred in the Tranſlation, as to have Latin Phraſes ſubſtituted in their room. But there are other Hebraiſms too, no leſs frequent, that afford us a juſter occaſion of doubting. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> often uſe to ſubjoyn an Infinitive to any other Mood or Tenſe of the ſame Verb, as <hi>dying thou ſhalt die, ſeeing I ſaw;</hi> and innumerable others that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in all the Hebrew Writers. If you tranſlate it <hi>verbatim</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> a Reader that only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands that Language, will ask you what's the meaning of that Phraſe, or whether 'tis a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58698:36"/>peculiar Emphaſis of the Hebrew Tongue or not? If you neglect the Hebraiſm, and omit the Infinitive, thoſe that have taken ſome pains about that Language, will complain that here's a notable Emphaſis loſt. Therefore let a Man manage himſelf as carefully as he can, yet he will lie under a neceſſity of diſpleaſing one or other. I know indeed that ſome of the later Interpreters, inſtead of the Infinitive, which the Latin will not bear, uſe ſome Adverb or other, to expreſs the Emphaſis which they imagine to lie conceal'd under this Phraſe, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Inſtead of <hi>moriendo morieris,</hi> they have <hi>utique morieris;</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.7. where we find <hi>videndo vidi,</hi> they turn it <hi>probè vidi.</hi> But though we ſhould grant there is ſome mighty force in this Hebrew Phraſe, if it can at any time be expreſs'd, as in the latter Example, I would deſire to know what is the meaning of <hi>utique morieris?</hi> Sometimes too they uſe the truſty Adverb <hi>omninò,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.20. <hi>Omninò vindicator,</hi> 22. <hi>Omninò mulctator,</hi> 28. <hi>Omninò lapidator,</hi> &amp;c. Which Phraſes after all are not perſpicuous to Latin Ears. Now for our part, we thought it much better to leave the Infinitive wholly out, either becauſe it cannot be expreſs'd in Latin, or becauſe 'tis not Emphatical, but only an uſual Form in the Hebrew Law, like which there are abundance in the Roman Law that are altogether redundant.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58698:37"/>Conſult the above-cited Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and our<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> as we render it; but in the Original 'tis, <hi>dying thou ſhalt die.</hi> Upon this place our Author obſerves, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> frequently joyn a Verb with the Infinitive or with a Verbal, but eſpecially in their Laws, rather to conform with the Cuſtom of their Language, than to denote any Emphaſis. <hi>Abimelech</hi> threatens, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.11. that whoever touches <hi>Iſaac</hi> or his Wife, <hi>ſhall die the death.</hi> So likewiſe among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but chiefly the <hi>atticks,</hi> we ſee that Nouns of the ſame Signification are frequently joyn'd to Verbs, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And ſometimes among the <hi>Latins</hi> we meet with <hi>vitam vivere,</hi> and ſeveral Expreſſions of the like nature, where no Grammarian ever dreamt that a particular ſtreſs is to be laid upon the words, but continues our Author, <hi>In ſacris haud <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </note> Annotations on <hi>Geneſis</hi> 2.17.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we meet with words that have none of the ſame Efficacy in other Languages to match them, ſuch as <hi>Tholedoth, Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for amongſt the Latins, <hi>Generatio</hi> ſcarce ſignifies any thing elſe but the Action of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or the manner how Animals are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and ſometimes perhaps the ſame as <hi>Aetas,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: But with the Jews it does not only ſignifie this, but denotes Original, Anceſtors, and Poſterity. If you are minded to gratifie a Latin Reader, and tell him what <hi>Generation</hi> ſignifies amongſt the Hebrews, you muſt uſe a long-winded Periphraſis, which a ſimple Tranſlation will never indure.</p>
            <p>We frequently meet with the word <hi>Phakad</hi> in the Holy Scriptures, which uſes to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated <hi>viſitare, to viſit,</hi> and yet that is not the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58698:37"/>meaning of it as we have<note n="(b)" place="bottom">The Hebrew word properly ſignifies <hi>curam gerere,</hi> to take care of, and is taken in a two-fold Sence, for ſometimes it ſignifies the care of a Friend, and ſometimes that of a Revenger. He that turned the Septuagint Verſion into Latin before St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time, has tranſlated ſeveral places of it barbarouſly and unskillfully, which St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> by reaſon it was received in the Latin Churches, did not think fit to change. Hence it comes to paſs, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of barbarous, or at leaſt improper words, have crept into our Lexicons and Modern Verſions.</note> obſerved upon <hi>Geneſis</hi> 21.1.

               </gap>, &amp;c. Nor does this word ſignifie different things in reſpect of the various Conjugations, but even in the Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Kal,</hi> it ſometimes ſignifies a Kindneſs, and ſometimes a Puniſhment: A Kindneſs in the above-mention'd place of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. Nor does any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as I know of, afford us a word, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling this in ſignification, which may be taken both ways: But ſtill it is to be tranſlated, and 'tis incredible what trouble theſe and ſuch other words give the Interpreter. We have tranſlated it <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.1. <hi>Curam gerere,</hi> not that it pleaſed us, but beccauſe we could think of nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If we had turned it, <hi>The Lord, as he ſaid, viſited</hi> Sarah. <hi>Jehovah, quemadmodum dixerat, Saram viſitavit,</hi> a Latin Reader would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood nothing elſe by it, but that an Angel viſited <hi>Sarah</hi> in the name of God, as the year before <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us three Angels had done the like, Chap. 18.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58698:38"/>
            <p>Since theſe, and innumerable Idioms of the like nature, are every where to be found in the Sacred Volumes, an Interpreter muſt take extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Pains to diſcharge his Duty Faithfully and Modeſtly, unleſs he would have his Fidelity call'd in queſtion, and his Boldneſs cenſur'd. We own indeed, 'tis not ſo great a Fatigue to tranſlate now, after ſo many great Men whoſe Tranſlations we have, as the firſt Interpreters to their Coſt found it. 'Tis undoubtedly true, that both the Ancient and Modern Tranſlations are mighty helps to us: Far be it from us who have found by Experience, how great a Task they ſuſtained, to detract from the Praiſes of theſe deſerving Men, or to deny the great Service they have done the World, by their endeavours to illuſtrate the Scriptures. Nay, we are ſenſible, that if they had not carried the Torch before us, we had not been able to reach ſo far, as even thoſe that have perform'd the worſt in this kind have done. But if we may be allowed to ſpeak the truth freely, the better part of the Ancients either ſlaviſhly follow'd the Track, or elſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed too far from it; and tranſlated the Hebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms either with too ſervile a Superſtition, or too bold a Freedom; nor was it a much leſs trouble to chuſe the beſt out of their ſeveral Verſions, than to ſee whether we could not find out a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our own. Generally ſpeaking. It was much eaſier to find what to cenſure, than what to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. To prevent being impos'd upon by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of others, every thing was to be carefully
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58698:38"/>weigh'd after the ſame manner, as if we had been the firſt that undertook ſuch a Work; otherwiſe we had relied on the Credit of other People, and neither ſatisfied the World nor our ſelves. Now what expence of Time and Pains it requires to perform all this, only thoſe are able to judge, who have attempted ſomething of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for others can never imagine it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Nevertheleſs, ſo many Hardſhips and Difficulties were to be overcome, to attain to a perfect Tranſlation, ſuch as we had conceived an Idea of in our Mind; but if we could not reach that heighth, we muſt be content to come as near it as poſſibly we could. Therefore we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to our ſelves conſtantly to follow a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way, that is, neither to render thoſe places that were obvious enough in the Original, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure with the Hebraiſms, nor out of too nice an Affection of writing Latin, to indulge our ſelves in too bold a Verſion.</p>
            <p>But this, you'll ſay, a thouſand People have threatned to do, many years before you were born, and yet we do not reſt ſatisfied with their Performances; Do you think then that you ſhall be able to anſwer our Expectations? No, I am not ſo blinded with Self-love as to imagine any ſuch thing; but ſince the Condition of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs is ſuch, that nothing is perfect in all Reſpects, and nothing pleaſes all alike, 'tis ſufficient if I do not incurr the Diſpleaſure of all, and if my Attempt does not lagg behind the Endeavours of others.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58698:39"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> formerly tranſlated the nobleſt Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of two of the moſt Eloquent Men that <hi>Athens</hi> ever bred, <hi>Aeſchines</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> one againſt another; neither did he literally tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate them like an Interpreter, as he tells us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the Tranſlations are not extant, but like an Orator, giving them all the Spirit, and Life, and beautiful turns of the Latin Tongue. As this was impracticable in a literal Verſion, he had a greater Reſpect to the Sence than the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for he did not think himſelf obliged to tell over all his Authors words to the Reader, but to give him them in weight. Now ſince this was not to be done in too ſtrict a Tranſlation of the Holy Books, we endeavoured to reach it in a looſer Paraphraſe, that ſo thoſe Perſons that are not delighted with the Barbarouſneſs of a Tranſlation, or do not underſtand Hebraiſms, may have ſomewhat to read and underſtand. But perhaps we have departed farther from our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal than <hi>Cicero</hi> did from his, becauſe the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language differs more from the Latin, than the <hi>Athenian</hi> way of Writing did from the <hi>Roman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, in our Verſion we have followed the Hebrew cloſer than the Purity of the Latin will allow us; but ſince it could not be avoided, we hope we ſhall make our Reader ſome amends by our Paraphraſe. Therefore though 'tis the confeſs'd Genius of the Latin Tongue, to love. Perſpicuity more than the Hebrew does; nay on the contrary, endeavours to avoid all
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58698:39"/>Obſcurity as much as it can; we acknowledge our Tranſlation to be ſomewhat Obſcure, but as we are uſed to commend Pictures not for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us a handſom Face, but for repreſenting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Life, ſo a Tranſlation, where the Language of the Original is clear, ought to be clear, and where it is obſcure, ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. Now we mean here by <hi>obſcure,</hi> not thoſe things that are obſcure to the ignorant in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, for then moſt of the Scripture Expreſſions would be obſcure; but thoſe that are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently underſtood, even by ſuch as are tolerably vers'd in that Language. On the other hand, by the word <hi>clear,</hi> we do not only mean thoſe things which are obvious to all Underſtandings, not excluding thoſe of the duller ſort, but which give no manner of Difficulty to the Skillful in that Language, or may be ſo expounded, as to leave no Doubt at all in the Minds of the Learned.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Now that we might be able to obſerve this Method through the whole Work, we laid it down for an unalterable Law in tranſlating the Hebraiſms, which ſo often occur:
<list>
                  <item>1. That all the clear Hebraiſms, which would bear a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, ſhould be tranſlated.</item>
                  <item>2. If any of them could not well be rendred into Latin, yet if our Ears were accuſtom'd to them, they ſhould be literally tranſlated.</item>
                  <item>3. That all obſcure He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſms ſhould be retained. Which it will not be amiſs to illuſtrate by a few Examples.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing is more common in Scripture, than Speeches and Dialogiſms that are uſher'd in by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58698:40"/>the Verb <hi>Vaijomer, &amp; dixit,</hi> or the Gerund <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, dicendo:</hi> Now 'tis evident that the former may be fully and pertinently expreſs'd by the Latin word <hi>inquit,</hi> the latter by <hi>his verbis,</hi> and yet the Interpreters have generally forborn to uſe them; as if this, forſooth, had been too great a Liberty to take. Now this runs through all the Bible, ſo that you may find an infinite number of Sentences with theſe words, <hi>&amp; dixit, and he ſaid.</hi> So in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3.1. <hi>And he ſaid to the Woman, yea hath,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>And the Woman ſaid unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, we may eat,</hi> &amp;c. 4. <hi>And the Serpent ſaid unto the Woman,</hi> &amp;c. 9. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, where art thou?</hi> 10. <hi>And he ſaid, I heard thy Voice,</hi> &amp;c. 11. <hi>And he ſaid, who told thee?</hi> &amp;c. 12. <hi>And the Man ſaid, the Woman,</hi> &amp;c. 13. <hi>And the Lord God ſaid unto the Woman,</hi> &amp;c. 14. <hi>And the Lord God ſaid unto the Serpent,</hi> &amp;c. 16. <hi>To the Woman he ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. 17. <hi>And unto</hi> Adam <hi>he ſaid.</hi> But why we ſhould ſervilely be confin'd to the order of the Hebrew words, as if there was ſomething extraordinary in them, we ſaw no reaſon; and the comparing of our Verſion with the reſt will ſhew, which of us has expreſs'd himſelf moſt agreeably to the Genius of the Latin Tongue. So Chap. 8.15. <hi>And God ſpake unto</hi> Noah, <hi>ſaying, Et loquutus eſi Jehova ad Noach, dicendo,</hi> or <hi>dicens,</hi> is indeed exactly conformable to the Hebrew words, but does not expreſs the meaning, any better than <hi>Alloquutus eſt Noachum Deus, his verbis.</hi> 'Tis certain that many of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by their obſcure Diligence, have made
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58698:40"/>their Tranſlations ſo inſupportable, that they are not to be read without Contempt. But let not the Reader imagine, that this is occaſion'd by the over great care they took to render even the leaſt Particles of Scripture as far as 'twas poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for if this Scruple had poſſeſs'd them, they had never tranſlated the obſcure places with ſo much boldneſs, as if it were not an invidious labour, we could eaſily ſhew.</p>
            <p>'Tis a common Hebraiſm <hi>to call ones name, vocare nomen alicujus,</hi> inſtead of <hi>nomen imponere, To give one the name of.</hi> As in Chap. 5.29. (and 'tis often in the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> alone) <hi>And ſhe called his name</hi> Noah, <hi>Et vocavit nomen ejus Noach,</hi> that is, <hi>Ei Noacho nomen indidit, Noa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum cum nomine appellavit.</hi> There's not the leaſt reaſon in the World to doubt but 'tis ſo, and yet after the vulgar Interpreter's Example, ſeveral ſince have tranſlated it <hi>Vocavit nomen ejus Noah,</hi> which is obſcure and barbarous, when the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Phraſe is plain enough.</p>
            <p>We frequently meet in the beginning of a Narration, <hi>Et fuit, And it came to paſs,</hi> in the Hebrew. As Chap. 6.1. <hi>Et fuit, cum caepit homo multiplicari, And it came to paſs, when Men began to multiply,</hi> &amp;c. which is the ſame in effect with ours, <hi>Cum in terris augeri coepiſſent,</hi> as alſo the vulgar has tranſlated it. But the <hi>Tigurine</hi> Verſion, and others have it barbarouſly, <hi>Et factum eſt, cum caepiſſent homines multiplicari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Interpreters have not only Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly every where tranſlated word for word,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58698:41"/>but have preſerv'd the very Situation of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew words, and the Conſtruction as far as they could conveniently, nay and farther too, but in this matter, we muſt own that we had a greater regard to the Latin than the Hebrew. We ſaw that a world of Hebraiſms had in ſpight of us crept into our Tranſlation; nor was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſince 'twas of no advantage to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to place the Latin words after the Hebrew manner, where it was plain, that though the Order was inverted, yet the Sence was not. <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> who publiſhed the <hi>Interlineary</hi> Tranſlation, as they call it, was obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Order, and as far as he was able, even the very number of the words: But thoſe that publiſh'd their Verſion apart from the Original, were not obliged in my opinion to be at ſo great an Expence to write barbarouſly. I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one inſtance to explain my meaning, The <hi>Tigurines,</hi> whoſe Tranſlation is otherwiſe not to be deſpiſed, have thus rendred the 15, 16, 17 Verſes of <hi>Gen</hi> 8. <hi>Loquutus eſt autem Deus ad Noah, dicens, Egredere ex arcâ, tu &amp; uxor tua, filii tui, &amp; uxores filiorum tuorum tecum. Cuncta animantia quae tecum ſunt, ex omni carne, tàm in volatili, quàm in jumento, tum etiam omni reptili quod reptat, educ tecum, &amp; repant in terrâ, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum edant, atque augeſcant.</hi> But we have done it thus. <hi>Tum allocutus eſt Noachum Deus, his verbis, Egredere ex arcâ tu, unáque tecum uxor tua, filii <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58698:41"/>pecudes, atque inter omnia reptilia quae in terris repunt, unà educito, repténtque in terrâ, &amp; in eâ creſcant, ac multiplicentur.</hi> There is nothing in the Hebrew words, which ours do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; nor has the Superſtitious Nicety of the <hi>Tigurines,</hi> unleſs I am miſtaken, perform'd more. But we do not cite this, or any other places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſomething remarkable in them, but becauſe we happened to meet with them firſt. To conclude, All the Tranſlations of the Old Teſtament we ever ſaw, are liable to the ſame Fault, excepting that of <hi>Seb. Caſtellio,</hi> which is ſomewhat too bold.</p>
            <p>'Tis by no means our Intention to blame thoſe Perſons, who in their Tranſlations of the Bible, have thought fit to deſpiſe all the Rules of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, as to their Periods; for ſince the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> have ſhorter turns of their Sentences, and are not ſubject to the ſame Laws as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> are, there would be a wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion indeed, if their Stile were to be ſuited to the Precepts of Rhetorick, which yet <hi>Caſtellio</hi> does too often. However I ſee no cauſe why we that ſpeak Latin, ſhould ſo Scrupulouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Hebrew order.</p>
            <p>There are other Hebraiſms, as we obſerv'd before, the Signification of which is no leſs known, and yet we are ſcarce able to tranſlate them into Latin, without a long Circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ſince our Ears are already accuſtom'd to ſome of them, we uſe them as the <hi>Latins</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did ſeveral Greek words which their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58698:42"/>Language wanted; and beſides they have been long ago naturalized, and made Free of the Church by the Latin Fathers. Some few Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of them we'll lay before the Reader, as we did of the former.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Geneſis</hi> Chap. 5.22, 24. and Chap. 6.9. <hi>Moſes</hi> has uſed <hi>incedere cum Deo, to walk with God,</hi> inſtead of that which in Latin we ſay, <hi>Sanctè ac piè vivere.</hi> However the Metaphor could not be changed, without aſſuming too great a Liberty, for who can endure <hi>Caſtellio</hi>'s tranſlating it, <hi>Ad dei voluntatem vitam agere, ex dei voluntate ſeſe gerere?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chap. 6.9. <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Vir juſtus ac in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teger in generationibus ſuis: A Juſt Man, and perfect in his Generations.</hi> And Chap. 7.1. 'tis <hi>in eâ generatione; in that Generation,</hi> viz. that which was deſtroy'd in the Deluge. Every Body ſees 'tis all the ſame thing as if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>Noah</hi> was the only righteous Perſon among the Men of that Age; <hi>Caſtellio</hi> has tranſlated it <hi>Saeculum</hi> and <hi>Aetas,</hi> the latter of which is tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but the former cannot be endured. For what Man that has made but a ſmall progreſs in Hebrew, reading this Tranſlation, would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had a word which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwered <hi>Saeculum,</hi> when indeed they have not.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame nature is Chap. 6.8. <hi>Gratiam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire, to find Favour:</hi> Which Phraſe has ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Significations, and the Latin Tongue affords us no one ſingle Expreſſion that comes up to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58698:42"/>full extent of it. Sometimes where the Sence would bear it, we have tranſlated it, <hi>Si qua mihi eſt apud te gratia,</hi> for <hi>Si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis,</hi> as Chap. 18.3. but this was not to be done always. <hi>Caſtellio,</hi> Chap. 6.8. inſtead of that which <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſes by <hi>Noachus apud deum gratiam invenit,</hi> inverts the Phraſe, and turns it, <hi>Noae fuit propitius.</hi> Chap. 18.3. <hi>Si vis mihi gratiſſimum facere.</hi> Chap. 19.19. <hi>Tanto me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringis beneficio:</hi> In all which he has not once hit the force of the Hebraiſm, though he takes ſo large a Scope.</p>
            <p>We find in the ſame Chapter v. 19. a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hebraiſm, by which <hi>omne animal</hi> is call'd <hi>omnis caro,</hi> and for which <hi>Caſtellio</hi> uſes <hi>omnia corpora;</hi> but beſides that, 'tis too remote from the Hebrew word, <hi>Caro</hi> is ſo often taken in that Sence, both in the Scripture, and the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Writers, that 'tis much better to retain it, than interpret it by another.</p>
            <p>Thus in the firſt Verſe of Chap. 11. we read, <hi>Cum univerſa terra labii unius eorundémque ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum eſſet:</hi> The Phraſes are Hebrew, but we durſt not change them in the Latin, both becauſe we could not light upon Expreſſions proper to match them, as alſo becauſe Learned Men are not agreed about their meaning, as we have<note n="*" place="margin">See Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation VI.</note> obſerv'd about that place. <hi>Caſtellio</hi> has it thus, <hi>Cum autem uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus terrarum orbis eodem ſermone atque ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione uteretur.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:58698:43"/>
            <p>The ſame Reaſon, ſupported by the Frequency of the Phraſe, prevail'd with us to retain the Hebraiſm <hi>Anima mea, my Soul,</hi> inſtead of <hi>ego. Say, I pray thee,</hi> ſays <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Wife, Chap. 12.13. <hi>thou art my Siſter, that it may be well with me for thy ſake, and my Soul ſhall live becauſe of thee. Caſtellio</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t tuâ causâ atque operâ meae utilitati, ſalutique conſulatur.</hi> The ſame Expreſſion is to be found often in <hi>Homer,</hi> which all the Interpreters have literally tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated.</p>
            <p>Many more Hebraiſms, we muſt confeſs, are to be found in our Tranſlation, which becauſe they were either obſcure, or of a doubtful Signification, we tranſlated literally, leſt we ſhould obtrude our own private Conjecture upon the Reader, for the true meaning of the Sacred Writers. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too we have retain'd even the words, when we ſaw the Learned diſputed about the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them with doubtful Succeſs; but a few Examples will ſooner ſhew whether we did well in this, than a long Harangue.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chap. 6.14. we turn'd <hi>Arcam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies nidis inſtructam,</hi> rather than <hi>manſiunculis</hi> after St. <hi>Jerom</hi> or <hi>Cellis,</hi> becauſe, though ſeveral rooms ſeem to be underſtood, in which the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were lodged ſeparately, yet for all we know <hi>Moſes</hi> may mean a Floor, or ſomething elſe that is called <hi>Kinnim. Caſtellio</hi> borrows the word <hi>Loculata</hi> out of <hi>Varro,</hi> who calls a Fiſh-pond ſo, where the Fiſh are kept in ſeveral Cheſts, which ſuits not ill with this place, though we durſt not follow him.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:58698:43"/>
            <p>What ſeems to be the meaning of <hi>Servus Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorum,</hi> Gen. 9.25. we have ſhewn in our<note n="(c)" place="bottom">As in a numerous Family there are ſeveral ſorts of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſo ſome of them are in a more honourable Poſt than others, and command thoſe below them, who may therefore be ſaid to be Servants of Servants.

So long as Men were but few in number, and mindful of their common original lived together; there ſeems to have been no ſuch thing as a Slave or Servant in the World; for the two cauſes of Servitude, Poverty and Force, were wanting. But upon the Diſperſion of Mankind into abundance of Colonies, ſeveral that were not able to maintain themſelves without a dependance upon others, parted with their Liberty merely to be ſuſtained. After the Trade of War became faſhionable, many that were taken Priſoners by the Enemy, and had their Lives ſpared, were by Force reduced to the State of Slaves, partly that they might not be in a Capacity to hurt them for the future, and partly that they might not be kept Gratis; and the <hi>Vernae,</hi> that is, the Sons of theſe, were, by the Misfortune of their Birth, ſubjected to the ſame Condition.</note> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations upon that place.

            <p>Chap. 6.4. we find this paſſage in <hi>Moſes, There were Nephilim</hi> (we render it Giants) <hi>in thoſe days;</hi> where the word<note n="(e)" place="bottom">The Radix <hi>Naphal,</hi> from whence this word is undoubtedly derived, not only ſignifies <hi>to fall,</hi> but <hi>to ruſh on</hi> after the manner of Robbers; for which reaſon <hi>Aquila</hi> tranſlated it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Nephilim</hi> ſeems to import Robbers; but becauſe it does not fully appear whether ſuch ſort of People are meant in that place, we thought it adviſable to retain the Hebrew word. They that after the Septuagint and vulgar Tranſlation have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated it <hi>Giants,</hi> have indeed own'd themſelves to be of their Opinion, but have brought no Arguments to prove it: And indeed, neither from the Story it ſelf, nor from the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, are they able to bring one proof that <hi>Giants</hi> are meant here. On the other hand, both the Story which relates them to be <hi>Viros Fortes,</hi> and the word it ſelf favour our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreation, yet for all that we durſt not inſert it amongſt <hi>Moſes</hi>'s words.</p>
            <p>For the ſame reaſon we have not changed the word <hi>Shiloh,</hi> Chap 49.10. becauſe its Signification
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58698:44"/>is unknown. Our<note n="*" place="margin">See Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation XII.</note> Annotations upon that place have made it appear, that no one knows what is the true meaning of it. However were we to chuſe our Opinion, we ſhould incline to follow the Tranſlation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> becauſe it is leſs Obnoxious to the Calumny of the Jews, and cannot be pretended to carry the leaſt Partiality in Favour of the Chriſtian Syſtem. Therefore in our Paraphraſe we have taken the ſame courſe with the LXX, but in the Verſion rather choſe to make uſe of the Hebrew word.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But a much greater Difficulty we found it, to tranſlate the Conjunctions and Prepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by reaſon of the different meaning which each of them has in the Holy Scriptures. For whereas the Latin Conjunctions and Prepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have not ſo large a Signification, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of them is ſo far reſtrain'd by the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Sentence, that they can only be taken in one Sence; but among the Hebrews, who take but little notice of their Situation, one ſmall Particle has the Significations of the Latin ones. So that if we ſhould ſometimes uſe a Latin Conjunction or Prepoſition, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally anſwers that in the Hebrew, our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would appear very uncouth to a Latin Ear; but if we uſe another, we fix a determin'd Sence of our own, upon that which ſeems to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Hebrew. Let us do what we can, we ſhall find it a difficult matter to avoid theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; nay I dare ſay, no Interpreter was ever yet able to do it.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:58698:45"/>
            <p>For inſtance, <hi>Vau</hi> ſupplies the place of all the Conjunctions, and if we may believe <hi>Chr. Noldius,</hi> has ſeventy three Significations, the chief of which is Copulative, like that of the Latin Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction <hi>Et.</hi> Nevertheleſs if it were always tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated like <hi>Et,</hi> it would not only be the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable thing in the World to one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Latin, but nothing would be more obſcure and perplex'd, ſince with the <hi>Latins</hi> 'tis not all one whether you ſay <hi>Et,</hi> or whether you ſay <hi>Atque, Aut, Tamen, Certè,</hi> &amp;c. Now if it ſo happens that the place is doubtful, and the Conjunction <hi>Et</hi> cannot poſſibly be uſed, becauſe it would ſpoil the Sence in Latin, a Man muſt of neceſſity make uſe of another, and ſo determine the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that place, which before was doubtful.</p>
            <p>Now in this, as well as ſeveral other Matters, we find 'tis impoſſible to make a Tranſlation of the Scripture, without a Man's interpoſing his own Sence againſt his Will: Though it were to be wiſh'd that the Sacred Volumes could be ſo tranſlated, that our own Conjectures might not be read, inſtead of the Divinely Inſpir'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's meaning, whether obſcure or clear. But this is impracticable for the above-mention'd Reaſons; and therefore after we have done all that we can, to explain the Sence of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as plainly as 'tis poſſible, the World muſt either acquieſce in our Endeavours, or every one muſt ſtudy Hebrew in his own defence, and take the beſt Method he can to ſatisfie himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:58698:45"/>
            <p>We have taken that care all along in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, as very ſeldom to interpoſe our own Judgment, where the place was ſomewhat doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but it was impoſſible to uſe this Caution every where. However we have faithfully ſet down in our Annotations, what Conjunction or Prepoſition was read in the Hebrew word.<note n="(f)" place="bottom">In the Hebrew 'tis <hi>and</hi> Noah, <hi>and he ſtaid,</hi> but M. <hi>le Clerk</hi> has tranſlated it <hi>Noachus tamen, Expectavit tamen.</hi> But with our Author's leave, <hi>haec videntur eſſe</hi>

But we, in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Hebrew Particles, have never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from the moſt commonly received Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, unleſs we were abſolutely forced to do it, although ſometimes it was none of the moſt proper. For we are well ſatisfied, that all Nations in the World do not connect their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58698:46"/>after the ſame manner, and that we are not to introduce them uſing the ſame Thread of Narration, if we deſign faithfully to Copy their different ways of Speaking. If this had been duly conſidered by that Learned Author, who has obliged the World with a laborious and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Book, called, <hi>The Concordance of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> he had mightily leſſened the Significations which he attributes to them, for very often he minds nothing elſe, but how to ſubſtitute an agreeable, or a more emphatical Latin Particle in the place of the Hebrew.</p>
            <p>The ſame ingenious Perſon has obſerved, that theſe Particles are ſometimes redundant, and ſometimes deficient, which he has evinced by ſeveral unqueſtionable Examples, though ſome of them 'tis true may be call'd into queſtion.

            <p n="7">VII. To this may be added, their everlaſting way of forming their Narrations, by Preterper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58698:47"/>or Future Tenſes joyn'd together by the Conjunction <hi>Vau,</hi> which gave us no ſmall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 'Tis very certain that no Emphaſis is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by it, and that it may beſt be expreſs'd by Latin Participles, or other Particles, with which the <hi>Latins</hi> uſe to joyn the parts of their Sentences together, as all Interpreters have done, although ſome of them have uſed this Liberty more ſparingly than others. However 'tis an eternal Drudgery in a ſtrict Tranſlation, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to change the ſtructure of the Phraſe; nor indeed can any thing excuſe our ſo doing but mere Neceſſity. Therefore in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> we were often forced to omit the Conjunction, and exchange it for the Latin Particles <hi>verò, autem, deinde, tum, enim, poſtea, dein, quoque, etiam, at que,</hi> and ſuch-like. At other times we uſed Participles, as the Reader will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in abundance of places, if he comparts our Tranſlation with the Hebrew. For inſtance, the two and thirtieth Chapter is thus joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Which would be inſupportable in Latin.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Verſions of the Bible, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially into the Modern Languages, which have all along preſerved this Conjunction, as if it added ſome peculiar Energy or Beauty to the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58698:47"/>but thoſe that are acquainted with the Genius of the Hebrew Tongue, can ſatisfie them of the contrary. In a plain Narration indeed, this troubleſome Conjunction may pretty well be born in ſome other Tongues; but in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument or ſo, if it were uſed in French, it would not only wound the Ears in a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſo fatally diſturb the Sence, that what would be clear in Hebrew, would be in French the moſt confuſed Stuff imaginable.</p>
            <p>However in this, as well as other things, too great a Licenſe is to be avoided, leaſt by omitting a Particle, or altering the ſtructure of a Sentence, we may happen to alter the Sence, and render the Narration indirect and oblique. For by this means an unskillful Reader will imagine, that ſome things are related <hi>en paſſant,</hi> while the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian makes haſte to go to others that are more material. Thus according to our Tranſlation, <hi>Moſes</hi> begins the 32d Chapter in theſe words, <hi>Jacobus iter ſuum perrexit, occurrerúntque Angeli Dei, quos cum vidit Jacobus, haec ſunt ait Dei caſtra, eique loco Machanajim nomen impoſuit.</hi> By this manner of relating the Story, 'tis plain that the meeting of the Angels is made a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Circumſtance, than if we had rendred it with <hi>Caſtellio, Jacobus iter ſuum perrexit, in quo cum ei Divini Angeli occurriſſent, ille eis viſis ita dixit, hoc divinum agmen eſt. Itaque locum inde Machanaim appellavit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was no ſmall Perplexity to us in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, that not only the Beginning, Progreſs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58698:48"/>and Concluſion of the ſame thing, were expreſs'd by Verbs that were tacked together by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing Conjunction <hi>Vau,</hi> but likewiſe by one and the ſame Verb. Thus in the above-cited Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>went,</hi> the Hebrew word may be as well taken to ſignifie the Beginning of a Journey, as the Continuation of it. However we tranſlated it in the latter Sence, as the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there required.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. We have already declared in the eighth Section of the former Diſſertation, that we have follow'd the Maſoretick Copy in our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But although we call it <hi>Copy</hi> in the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Number, it may be called <hi>Copies,</hi> ſince by this name we comprehend both the Readings in the Text, and thoſe in the Margin, which came from two ſeveral Books; unleſs we ſuppoſe that the <hi>Keri</hi> proceeded from the received way of reading in the Synagogue of <hi>Tiberias</hi> by ſome <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> as 'tis called; and the <hi>Ketib</hi> to have been the Reading it ſelf, written in a Book of venerable Antiquity. However the matter was, as theſe two Readings have been deſervedly compared by the generality of Tranſlators, ſo that which ſeem'd the beſt we juſtly preferr'd, and this is the conduct we follow'd. Sometimes indeed the <hi>Keri</hi> affords a more convenient Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the <hi>Ketib,</hi> but the latter very often is better than the former. But as I often thought of this, and ſeveral other things of the like nature, I ſuſpected that the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> to inhance the value of their Trade, obſerv'd the ſame Conduct as the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58698:48"/>Greek Rhetoricians were ſaid to do, <hi>Who least the World ſhould imagine they knew but few things, invented abundance of ſtrange Terms that were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, that their Art might have the Reputation of being more difficult than really it was.</hi> However, we have all along follow'd the Maſoretick way of Pointing, except that with the generality of Interpreters we have not minded the Accents, but only followed the Sence and the Structure of the words. We ſhall not here repeat what ſeveral Learned Men have ſaid upon this occaſion. Let the Reader only turn over the 23d Chapter of <hi>Buxtorf</hi>'s <hi>Theſaurus,</hi> lib. 2. where he treats of this Subject, and he will be ſatisfied that what I have advanced concerning the <hi>Rabbins</hi> is true, and that theſe Maſters affect an abſtruſe unedifying Knowledge, and have clogg'd a Study, which otherwiſe would be eaſie enough, with endleſs Difficulties of their own raiſing. The two firſt words of <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confute all that Learning.</p>
            <p>Of greater moment is the diſtinction of <hi>Verſes,</hi> as they are called, which however <hi>Elias Levita</hi> a Jew, and ſeveral Chriſtians, have demonſtrated to have been made by none of the Prophets. And indeed this diſtinction is not to be found in the Manuſcript Copies of the Old Interpreters, nor can be uſed in many places, without maiming the Period, or dividing the Verb from what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to it, which is extremely ridiculous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though to comply with a received Cuſtom, and that the Citations might more eaſily be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58698:49"/>found o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> we have diſtinguiſhed the Verſes by Numbers, yet we have only had a regard to the Sence in the manner of our Pointing; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Period (if the parts of a Sentence in the Latin Tranſlation of an Hebrew Book may be called by that name) ends with the Verſe, and ſometimes it is carried beyond it. Nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it begins in the middle of a Verſe, and ſometimes it terminates with it, as ſeem'd moſt agreeable to the nature of the Latin Tongue.</p>
            <p>The Reader will likewiſe find, both in our Tranſlation and Paraphraſe, two other ſorts of Diviſions, which we muſt give him an account of. We have not always follow'd the Chapters in the diſtinction of our Sections, although in complaiſance to the ancient Cuſtom, we have mark'd them on the top of the Page, and in the Margin, but we have divided the Argument into greater or leſſer Sections, according as the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact happen to be connected. And this we did upon the following Conſideration, that both the whole Argument in one Series, and our Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon it, might be read in the ſame order, becauſe both the Divine Hiſtorian, and our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon him, would by this means be better underſtood. 'Tis certain, the Jews have their own Sections, plainly different from our Chapters, which they follow in their publick Readings in their Synagogues.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, we have divided every Section into ſeveral <hi>Paragraphs,</hi> (to borrow a Term of Art from the Lawyers) though ſomewhat of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58698:49"/>longeſt, which we ſuppoſed would contribute to the Perſpicuity of the Hiſtory, and be of great Advantage to the Reader. For where the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reaſonings, or ſeveral parts of the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not continued as it were in the ſame breath with the reſt, but divided by certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, we better comprehend both the Parts and Series of the Oration, and imprint it on our Memory, and if there be occaſion, recollect it in our Minds. This is the reaſon why the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians in former times, to diſtinguiſh the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Chorus's in their Tragedies, and the Lawyers to diſtinguiſh the Heads of their Laws, made uſe of <hi>Paragraphs.</hi> And therefore, though in the Manuſcripts and in the Editions no diſtinctions of this nature do appear, (for we do not mind the Jewiſh) yet we thought it <hi>à propos</hi> to make uſe of them, as being clearly of opinion, that nothing ought to be deſpiſed, which tends to Perſpicuity, and the Convenience of the Reader.</p>
            <p>Nor will any one, as we imagine, blame theſe our Diviſions, as if they contradicted what we ſo ſolemnly profeſſed before, <hi>viz.</hi> That we would follow the Copies of the <hi>Maſorites.</hi> For though theſe Diviſions are very ſerviceable to Perſpicuity and Order, yet they make not the leaſt Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Reading or Pronouncing of words, in which two reſpects we ſaid we look'd upon theſe Copies to be the moſt correct of all.</p>
            <p>We hope the Reader will not be diſpleaſed, that after the Example of ſeveral Modern Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58698:50"/>we have not written the Proper Names, as they are now a-days read by the Jews. Our Ears have been ſo long accuſtom'd to them, that we can ſcarce endure thoſe that either ſpeak or pronounce them otherwiſe; for who with any Patience could hear a Fellow thunder out <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahan, Jitſchak, Jahacob, Moſche, Jehoſchubak,</hi> &amp;c. as thoſe names are pronounced by the Jews, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the roughneſs of their Language. There are alſo ſeveral words that were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe read by the LXX Interpreters than they are by the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laim; Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> not <hi>Nebuchadnetſar,</hi> and ſuch-like. Which of them pronounced the righteſt, we ſhall not now enquire, for we do not regard the thing it ſelf, but only the Cuſtom of the Chriſtian Churches from the Beginning.</p>
            <p>But then we obſerv'd this Conduct, to ſet down the more celebrated and uſual Names after the Chriſtian manner, and the leſs known and frequent after the Jewiſh, becauſe, generally ſpeaking, they do not ſeem to be written true in the Greek and Latin Books. Where-ever we have neglected to do it, the Reader is to impute it to our being too attentive upon the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſequently not able to mind the words, and not imagine that we did it on purpoſe.</p>
            <p>As for what regards the Letters, we have herein follow'd the Ancients, that is to ſay, <hi>Beth</hi> has always the power of the Latin, <hi>B, Zain</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced like a <hi>Z, Cheth</hi> as a <hi>X,</hi> which comes the neareſt of any to the double Aſpiration of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58698:50"/>Hebrew Letter, which in our Commentary we have expreſs'd by a double <hi>H,</hi> where we have obſerv'd how the Hebrew words are to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>Teth</hi> like a <hi>T, Jod</hi> like the <hi>J</hi> Conſonant of the French, <hi>Caph</hi> like a <hi>X, Ain</hi> like an <hi>H,</hi> though 'tis of a different ſound, but we could not think of a better. <hi>Pe</hi> like the φ of the <hi>Greeks; Tſaddi</hi> like <hi>Tſ; Koph</hi> like <hi>K; Schin</hi> always after the ſame manner, that is, as <hi>ch</hi> is pronounc'd by the <hi>French, ſch</hi> by the <hi>Germans, ſh</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and laſtly, <hi>Tau</hi> like the Greek θ. We could give our Reaſons for this way of Pronunciation, if they would not take up too much room in this Diſſertation. But thoſe that are not ſo well vers'd in theſe things, may conſult <hi>Druſius</hi>'s old Hebrew Alphabet. But as we hinted before, in the more remarkable Names we have had a greater regard to Cuſtom, than to the power of the Letters, and at other times thought it ſufficient to make uſe of thoſe Latin Letters that neareſt reſembled them.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Foraſmuch as we have endeavour'd to tranſlate, and write Annotations upon the Sacred Volumes of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> after ſo many Learned Men, we freely acknowledge that we have all along made uſe of the Labours of other Writers, and derived conſiderable Aſſiſtances from them. In the firſt place, we profeſs that we have always conſulted the Old and Modern Tranſlations in all difficult places, but ſo as never to give a blind aſſent to what they ſay, but eſpecially the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns. We weigh'd and examin'd every Word
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58698:51"/>and Expreſſion, if it contain'd any Difficulty, with no leſs Care and Application than if no one had gone this way before us, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd the Reaſons of them which we knew to be certainly ſo. Yet a vaſt difference ought to be made between the Ancient and the later Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which we have accurately obſerved; for ſince, as we took notice in the former Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ancient Interpreters were able to know the Significations of Words and Phraſes from the uſe of the Languages then in being, their very Authority is by no means to be deſpiſed, when it oppoſes no Reaſons deduced from Grammar. On the other hand, The Opinions of the Modern Interpreters, unleſs they are ſupported by the Truth, ought to be little regarded, becauſe they had no other way to find out the Meaning of the Scripture, but by long Study as well as we; and therefore are not to be admitted, unleſs they give ſubſtantial Grounds for what they avouch. This is the Reaſon why we ſeldom borrow'd any Teſtimony from the new Tranſlations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that after all the plauſible Reaſons they give for their particular Verſions; yet whether the Authority of their Tranſlations goes for or againſt us, 'tis of it ſelf of no weight at all. However we would not be ſo miſ-underſtood as if we deſpiſed them, ſince we have frequently uſed them with great Advantage on our ſide; but we thought our ſelves obliged to make this open Confeſſion, that the Reader might know once for all, why we alledge their Authority ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58698:51"/>ſeldom. Beſides, all or moſt of their Verſions could not be compared, without too great a Fatigue to the Reader, and too tireſom a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity; nor cenſured, without incurring the Envy of ſeveral ill-diſpoſed Perſons, which we would willingly avoid. Wherefore we thought it more adviſed, to omit all the Modern Verſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and only to take our Teſtimonies from the Ancient, and to compare them one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though we are far from pretending to give an accurate Collation of them. This would have proved too tedious a Work, and indeed far different from our Deſign, who intended to find out what the Sacred Writers meant, and not how often or how much the Interpreters have deviated from their Sence.</p>
            <p>We have likewiſe conſulted the Annotations and Commentaries of ſeveral Writers, but more eſpecially have we read over a far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Books, that have occaſionally treated of Sacred things, and explained ſeveral Paſſages of Scripture. Out of all theſe, whatever ſeem'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and to the purpoſe, have we inſerted into our Commentaries, and indeed we have generally cited the names of the latter. But as for thoſe who have profeſſedly written upon the Sacred Books, we have more ſeldom made uſe of their Names, becauſe, as they may be eaſily conſulted, ſo large Collections out of their Books are in every Bodies hands. Our principal Aim was, to ſet down thoſe Obſervations, by which we believed the Scriptures might be illuſtrated,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58698:52"/>and not to ſwell our Volume with a Catalogue of Names, which have no Authority in things of this nature. But as we ſaid before, we have more frequently cited by name thoſe that have not writ a continued Commentary, as well out of Gratitude, becauſe ſome of them have given us much greater Helps than all the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors put together; as alſo becauſe we might give a ſhort Abridgment of their Opinions; and it would be no ſuperfluous Labour to direct the Reader where he might find them delivered more at large.</p>
            <p>We have already, in part, explain'd the Deſign of our Commentary in the ſecond Section, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſhall add, That we have obſerv'd that choice in ſelecting the Interpretations, as only to referr to thoſe that ſeem'd to be the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all, and lay down the Reaſons that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, omitting a Confutation of the reſt, except a very few upon the moſt difficult places, and where they might be comprehended in a few words. It had been in our Opinion a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Work, and (to ſpeak a bold Truth) of very little uſe, if we had been obliged to cite the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of all the Commentators, to have added their ſeveral Reaſons, to have particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed what we thought improbable, and to defend what we looked upon to be the beſt grounded. Such an Undertaking would far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in bulk every thing that has yet been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd upon the Scripture, and would rather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the Reader than help him. Indeed thoſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58698:52"/>that attempt to explain the Bible, would be very unhappy Perſons, if they were forced to ſet down all the Conjectures of other Men, for no other reaſon, but merely becauſe they writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Nay, the Readers would be in a more miſerable Condition, if they were not allow'd to paſs their Judgment upon the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, unleſs they heard and weigh'd the Opinions of all. Both of them muſt in their own defence lay aſide all Examination of the Holy Volumes, ſince the Life of a Patriarch would not be long enough to go through ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite a Labour. And therefore we have made uſe of our own Judgment in our choice of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations which we produce and examine in the doubtful places, and yet we would have no one inferr from hence, that we deſpiſed all the reſt, which either are already made publick, or lie conceal'd in the Cabinets of the Learned; for although out of an Infirmity common to all Mankind, and even through our own fault, we own we may err, yet it may eaſily happen, that while a Man is diſtracted with multiplicity of Thoughts, many things may eſcape him, and that ſeveral excellent Interpretations may be out abroad in the World, which he never ſo much as heard of.</p>
            <p>How unwilling we are to neglect any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpretation, where the Sence is doubtful, the Reader will ſoon be convinc'd, if he obſerves how often we refrain our hand, which we have already hinted, and need not here repeat.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:58698:53"/>
            <p n="10">X. Since the Hebrew Tongue, ſuch as it has come down to us, is contain'd in the ſmall Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the Old Teſtament, wherein are ſeveral Words and Phraſes that occurr but once, or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and are not ſufficiently clear'd by the Sence of the places, we often thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to borrow aſſiſtance from the neighbouring Languages, as we ſaw had been practis'd by Men of the greateſt Learning before us with general Approbation. If out of all the Latin Authors, we had only <hi>Livy</hi>'s Works for inſtance now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, I make no queſtion but that a world of obſcure Paſſages in him, might be happily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by the <hi>Italian, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; for there are ſtill remaining in thoſe Tongues, many Roots and Derivatives from an infinite number of Latin words, which might be of great uſe to illuſtrate that Hiſtorian; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeveral Perſons of the firſt Rank, not without good reaſon, have ſucceſsfully borrow'd helps from the other Oriental Languages, to prove which Aſſertion Monſieur <hi>Bochart</hi> alone will furniſh us with ſeveral Examples, and the Reader may farther ſatisfie himſelf by conſulting our own Annotations.</p>
            <p>And yet this aſſiſtance is not unadviſedly, or without warrantable grounds to be uſed, for it frequently happens, even in Languages which are derived from the ſame Stock, that words of a like ſound have yet a very different Signification.

And this very thing, even in the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Latin Authors, has often deceiv'd thoſe Perſons whoſe Mother-Tongues were derived from the Latin, while the words thus derived from the Latin, bear a quite different Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So while the <hi>Latins,</hi> by the word <hi>extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare,</hi> mean <hi>ejicere terminis, to turn one out of his Country;</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> by <hi>eſterminare,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> by <hi>exterminer,</hi> underſtand <hi>to deſtroy by killing,</hi> which are very different. Now if any <hi>French-man</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> were to read in <hi>Cicero, Orat. pro L. Flacco,</hi> that by the Valour of <hi>P. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Publicola,</hi> the Kings were <hi>exterminati,</hi> i.e. turn'd out, unleſs he were a Man of Learning above the common ſort, he would be apt to imagine, it might be tranſlated <hi>Verbatim</hi> as 'tis uſed in their own Language; whereas <hi>Cicero</hi> does by no means ſay, that the Kings were killed, but only turn'd out by <hi>Valerius.</hi> Nay, that moſt Learned Man, <hi>Deſ. Heraldus,</hi> in his Annotations upon <hi>Arnobius,</hi> lib. 1. p. 2. was of Opinion, that a certain place of that Writer was faulty, becauſe he underſtood the word as it is uſed in the French Tongue, <hi>Exterminati ſumus dum longè,</hi> ſays <hi>Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, examina maerorum tanta mortalium ſunt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portata ſaeculis.</hi> His meaning is, That ever ſince the Chriſtians leaving the Borders of <hi>Judea,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:58698:54"/>were ſpread all over the Roman Empire, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Calamities, if we may believe the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> afflicted the whole World. An infinite number of ſuch Examples may be found, by thoſe that will examine the Matter curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Hebrew words can only then be explain'd by the neighbouring Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, where the Sence and Circumſtance of places will naturally lead an Interpreter to them, for the Affinity of Sound and Signification are not ſufficient.

            <p n="11">XI. The moſt infallible way to trace the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of an obſcure word, is, in my Opinion, taken from the comparing of places, for when any word, where-ever we find it, has one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limited Signification that ſuits it beſt, we cannot forbear but we muſt think it true; and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58698:54"/>this is perform'd by the Modern Interpreters, who are furniſh'd with Lexicons and Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances, with much greater Succeſs than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients could pretend to, who were deſtitute of theſe helps. Nevertheleſs they have not gone ſo far, as to leave no Diſcoveries to be made by the Diligence of Poſterity. For it often happens, while they diſſent from thoſe of former Times, becauſe they do not comprehend the Reaſons they went upon, and while they indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too much in their own Conjectures which are wholly ſupported by obſcure or ambiguous places, that they fail of attaining the true Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſeveral words.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58698:56"/>of the Truth of this, as we could ſhew, if we were now treating of the Greek Tongue.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Furniſh'd with theſe helps eſpecially, not to mention any more, we begin our Tranſlation and Commentary upon the Old Teſtament. 'Tis true, ſeveral Learned Men have gone the ſame way before us, eſpecially in the laſt Age, and the beginning of this, who deſerve great Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their Performances. But if we may be allow'd to ſpeak the Truth, though they neither wanted Abilities nor Diligence, yet two things ſtood in their way, which hinder'd them from giving any laſting Satisfaction to thoſe that came after them.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, The want of due Helps, which we now enjoy; for we may juſtly ſay of the Writers of this Age, that they have taken more Pains in illuſtrating and cultivating the Sacred Philology, than was done in two thouſand years before. Hence it comes to paſs, that we have ſuch vaſt numbers of excellent Works to aſſiſt us to underſtand the Holy Volumes. The Truth of this ſufficiently appears by the Polyglott Bibles, the Lexicons, and Treatiſes of all ſorts that adorn our Libraries, which before had no ſuch Treaſures in them, and the reading of our Work, wherein they are ſo often commended, will undeniably evince it.</p>
            <p>The other was, The general Bent of the laſt Age, rather towards Theological than Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Learning, by reaſon of the new Controverſies that then employ'd the whole Chriſtian World;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58698:56"/>ſo that the Interpreters rather buſied themſelves to confute Errors, than give us a plain and critical Enarration of the words. I will not ſay, that by thus inclining their Studies, Men of Parts and Learning have been ſo far led out of the way, that they have ſought out Doctrines, which were true indeed, and agreeable to Religion, in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places, though nothing be more certain; however 'tis manifeſt, that by ſo doing, they have neglected ſeveral helps neceſſary for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Languages, ſince 'tis impoſſible for a Man to graſp every thing at the ſame time. They that have read the moſt celebrated Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Divines of the laſt Age, and examined their Tranſlations, know how true this is, and to prove it to thoſe that never looked upon them, would be labour loſt.</p>
            <p>They that employ'd their time moſt this way, chiefly depended upon ſome late Grammarians of the Jews and Modern <hi>Rabbins,</hi> but were in a manner deſtitute of all other Aſſiſtances of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Learning. I would fain know which of them in the laſt Age, applied the Hiſtories of the old Eaſtern People who border'd upon the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and what we find in ancient Authors relating to their Manners, Opinions, and their Country, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Illuſtration of the Scriptures; two or three perhaps and no more. Nevertheleſs St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had long ago adviſed, though no body would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him, That <hi>'twas one thing to compoſe Books of our own, as for inſtance about Covetouſneſs, Faith, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, Widows, and upon each of theſe Heads to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58698:57"/>Teſtimonies from all parts of the Bible, and ſet them off with a little ſecular Eloquence, and make a magnificent appearance upon ſuch common ſubjects; and another thing to dive into the Sence of the Prophets and Apoſtles, to know why they writ ſo, by what reaſons they ſupport their Opinions, what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar things the</hi> Idumeans, <hi>the</hi> Moabites, <hi>the</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites, <hi>the</hi> Tyrians, <hi>the</hi> Philiſtines, <hi>the</hi> Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>and</hi> Aſſyrians <hi>have to themſelves in the Old Teſtament. For 'tis neceſſary,</hi> continues he, <hi>that they ſhould have different Cauſes, and Arguments, and Originals, according to the Diverſity of Places, and Times, and Men, to whom they were written.</hi> But neither in St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time, nor afterwards, did any one, before our Age, regard this Advice as it deſerved; ſo that our Anceſtors have left us a very ample Harveſt for this ſort of Learning; upon this account we may pretend to ſet out more accurate Tranſlations and Annotations upon the Scriptures than they did, though we are otherwiſe inferior to them in Wit, Learning and Induſtry. In their times Theological and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precepts could hardly be inculcated enough, but now ſince they are known to all, we lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no neceſſity to dwell upon them any longer Therefore have we employ'd our ſelves in that way of Interpretation which we have deſcrib'd in this Diſſertation, and have endeavour'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Laws we enjoyn'd our ſelves very Religiouſly.

            <p>THE two former Diſſertations had a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the other Books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58698:58"/>as well as to thoſe of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but now we intend to treat of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Writings, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the reſt; for we cannot well omit the Diſcuſſion of that celebrated Queſtion, which has been ſo warmly debated in this Age, <hi>viz. Whether</hi> Moſes <hi>writ the Pentateuch.</hi> Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that have made no ſmall noiſe in the World, have poſitively aſſerted that it was not writ by <hi>Moſes;</hi> or at leaſt, that, ſuch as it has come down to our hands, it is not wholly his. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we in our Commentaries, according to the received Opinion of the moſt ancient Times, have all along attributed it to him. Therefore we muſt now enquire, which of the two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is moſt agreeable to Truth; and this we ſhall perform after ſuch a manner, as not to bring the leaſt Reproaches or invidious Reflections, but only Reaſon and Arguments, againſt thoſe that are of the contrary ſide; neither out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable Prepoſſeſſion, ſhall we deny thoſe things that are evidently plain. Then after we have fully proved the Pentateuch to be the Work of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we ſhall endeavour to find out his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in writing it. No Thinking Man will doubt, but that both theſe Diſquiſitions are of the laſt Conſequence towards the better underſtanding of theſe Books; and ſince they could not ſo conveniently be handled in our Commentary, we ſhall diſpatch them in this Diſſertation with all the brevity we can.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There are three ſorts of things to be found in the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which we muſt here
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58698:58"/>take into our Conſideration. We ſhall have ſoon done with the two firſt, but we ſhall dwell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer upon the laſt. The firſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends thoſe things which were done before <hi>Moſes</hi> was born, at leaſt before he came to years of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity; of which nature is the Hiſtory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and here (if we except a few places which we ſhall hereafter examine) we find nothing that may induce us to believe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author. No body doubts, but that the Creation of the World, and the other Matters of Fact, which are there related down to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Parents, might be written by him. Learned Men only doubt whether <hi>Moſes</hi> really writ them, and if he writ them, whether he was the firſt that convey'd them down to Poſterity in writing, or whether he might not take what he has from ancienter Memoirs, which were afterwards loſt.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt that writ of theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and they were never conſign'd in Writing before, it neceſſarily follows, that he muſt either have them by an immediate Revelation from God, or elſe that they were communicated to him by Men, who preſerved them in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; for there is no other way for him to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the Knowledge of them. Now he no where tells us, they were communicated to him by God; nor, though ſuch a thing is poſſible, yet ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſilent in the matter, dares any one pretend to affirm it as an undoubted Truth, but only the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who were never aſham'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58698:59"/>of Lying, and whoſe Aſſertions conſequently are not much to be regarded. Now it ſcarce ſeems probable, that ſo many Names, and the Particulars of ſo many Years, could be handed down by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. 'Tis much more probable, that the ancient Patriarchs left them in Writing, and ſo tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to their Poſterity; which Monuments coming into the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he diligently copied and connected them with the Hiſtory of his own Age; for what Deſign and Purpoſe we ſhall afterwards enquire. Now what ſort of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings they were, and how numerous, only thoſe Perſons can inform us, who lived in thoſe Times, if they were reſtor'd to Life again.

               </note> See our Notes upon Chap. 4.23, 24. and Chap. 7.11. 'Tis certain that almoſt all Nations in the World preſerved the Fragments of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt Hiſtories in Verſe, as ſeveral Learned Men
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58698:59"/>have proved: And it appears, that even among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, the Memory of great Actions was celebrated in Verſe, which the People learn'd by Heart, as the Songs of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, that are extant both in <hi>Exodus</hi> 15. and <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 32. demonſtrate. Nay, God himſelf commanded the latter to be learn'd by the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as we find in <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.29. Nor ought any one to wonder, that we carry the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Poetry ſo high, ſince Muſick, by the Invention of ſome Inſtruments, flouriſh'd even before the Deluge, as <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly tells us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.21. Nay, 'tis probable, that Men employ'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Vocal Muſick, before they thought of the Inſtrumental. But though ſome few memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tranſactions might be preſerv'd in Verſe, which the long-liv'd Patriarchs perhaps might have by heart, yet a Chronology, including the Calculation of ſo many years, ſeems too unruly an Argument to have been included in them. And <hi>Moſes</hi> makes mention of the <hi>Book of the Battels of the Lord,</hi> of which we ſhall treat when we come to <hi>Numbers</hi> 21.14.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of things, which we read in the Pentateuch, 'tis evident were written by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf. <hi>Firſt,</hi> God commanded him to write the Law, and <hi>Moſes</hi> is accordingly ſaid to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it. In <hi>Exodus</hi> 34.27. God, after he had repeated the chief Precepts of the Law, thus ſpeaks to <hi>Moſes, Write thou theſe words, for after the Tenour of theſe words, I have made a Covenant with thee and with</hi> Iſrael. But in <hi>Exodus</hi> 24.4. after ſeveral
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58698:60"/>Laws were made, <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to have written <hi>all the Words of the Lord;</hi> and frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the Book of the Covenant, or Law, as in the ſeventh Verſe of the ſame Chapter. In <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 28.58. <hi>If thou wilt not obſerve,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes, to do all the words of this Law, that are written in this Book,</hi> which perhaps he then held in his hands; ſee likewiſe v. 61. and Chap. 29.20, 27. where the Curſes are ſaid to be writ in it. This does <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to the <hi>Levites,</hi> Chap. 31.9. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it v. 26. <hi>to be put in the ſide of the Ark, that it may be a Witneſs againſt</hi> Iſrael. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the ſame Book, as if it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all the Divine Laws, after the Death of <hi>Moſes, Joſhua</hi> 1.8. where <hi>Joſhua</hi> is commanded by God, not to ſuffer that Book to depart out of his Mouth, that is, perpetually to read it, and adminiſter Juſtice to the People out of the Laws deliver'd in it. See likewiſe Chap. 8.31.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that the <hi>Jews</hi> by the word <hi>Thorah, Law,</hi> are uſed to underſtand the whole <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> nevertheleſs 'tis certain, that it is of a doubtful Signification, and may ſignifie more or fewer Laws. So <hi>Joſhua</hi> 8.32. it is ſaid, that <hi>Joſhua wrote a Copy of the Law of Moſes,</hi> upon twelve Stones of an Altar, as he was commanded by the Book of the Law. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.2, 3. in all which places <hi>Thorah</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies only a ſmall part of the Law, as Learned Men have obſerved, becauſe it was not poſſible for the whole five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be writ
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58698:60"/>upon twelve Stones joyn'd together to make a four-ſquare Altar. But 'tis evident from the places above-mentioned, that at leaſt all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Law were written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and indeed ſo many troubleſom Laws could not be remembred, unleſs their Memories were refreſh'd by a written Book, eſpecially when they began to be obſerved. Some Perſons are of Opinion, that only the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the above-cited places of <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> and that afterwards that Book alone was found in the time of <hi>Joſiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah.</hi> But although <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Law, yet many things are there briefly handled; neither are they ſo clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were none of the acuteſt People in the World, and always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Idolatry, could have an accurate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the whole Law, only out of that Book; and therefore if <hi>Moſes</hi> deſign'd to have it all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, as no body queſtions but he did, he ought to have given the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> a larger Expoſition of it; and this he actually perform'd; for we have ſhown from two places of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that the Laws which we ſee there, were written by him, and not <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> alone. The Book in which he writ them, is called, <hi>The Book of the Covenant, Exod.</hi> 24.7. which after he had ſolemnly read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People, without queſtion he did not throw it away, ſince it was as it were a publick Inſtrument, wherein were preſerved the Laws of the Covenant made with God. Beſides <hi>Moſes</hi> writ
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58698:61"/>ſome other Treatiſes not extant in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> of which we ſhall diſcourſe hereafter, and which without doubt he bequeath'd to Poſterity, ſince they have arrived ſafe to our hands. Therefore the above-mentioned Conjecture, that only <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi> was left us by <hi>Moſes,</hi> is altogether groundleſs, and contrary to the Sacred Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Matters being thus, no one will doubt that the Laws which are contain'd in <hi>Exodus, Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, Numbers</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> are the very ſame that were written by <hi>Moſes.'</hi> Tis certain, that the Laws, which were written in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, were ſtill extant in the Reign of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. nor can any tolerable Reaſon be aſſign'd, why they were not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated at leaſt into the Books of the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> Therefore whatever Laws we find in the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch,</hi> we ought to look upon them as written by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, and conſequently the greateſt part by much of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> came from the ſame hand. Nay 'tis evident, that ſeveral other things were writ by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Moſes</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.22. to have written the Song which we find in the following Chapter; and ſince that is ſet down word for word as he made it, we cannot deny that the reſt which belong to the Law, are the very words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> without oppoſing the plaineſt Truths imaginable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He is in expreſs Terms ſaid to have written ſome part of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> for he tranſmitted in Writing the War againſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58698:61"/>the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and God's Sentence pronounced againſt them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.14. After the like manner he writ the ſeveral Manſions of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.2. Moſes <hi>wrote their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out according to their Journeys, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord.</hi> And yet that part of their Hiſtory, which we find in that Chapter of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> was not of ſo great a Conſequence as to be writ before the reſt; from whence it naturally follows, that the four laſt Books of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch,</hi> at leaſt, were written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for if he writ all the Laws, and the whole Hiſtory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he is certainly the Author of theſe Books, wherein nothing elſe is contain'd; for who, after <hi>Moſes</hi> had once written, would attempt to write and model them anew? Indeed if we conſider the frequent Repetitions which we met with in theſe Books, and the great diſorder in the delivery of the Law, we ſhall ſoon be inclin'd to think, that theſe Books are come to our hands, juſt as they were at ſeveral times firſt written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that long uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Pilgrimage in <hi>Arabia Deſerta:</hi> For if they had been compil'd out of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Memoirs, they had certainly been digeſted into better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and all the Repetitions had been cut off, as is uſually done in Works of that nature; but if we except a few Paſſages, they have deſcended to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity juſt as they were publiſh'd at firſt, when a full Collection was made of all that <hi>Moſes</hi> writ, and at ſeveral times repeated to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who after all theſe Repetitions, did ſcarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their own Law ſufficiently. But about the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58698:62"/>middle of this Age, a certain Author that ſhall be nameleſs ſtarted up, whoſe Opinion afterwards found ſome Diſciples, and theſe have been ſo hardy, as to deny that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Writer of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and pretend to ſhew ſeveral Paſſages in him, which were manifeſtly writ ſince his time. <hi>Aben-ezra</hi> indeed had formerly deliver'd himſelf much to the ſame purpoſe, but worded it ſo warily, and obſcurely, that he is hardly to be underſtood. Now we will here conſider their Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Their Arguments are partly drawn from the Stile of the whole Book, and partly from particular places. As for the former, they pretend that the difference of Stile, which is eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> plainly ſhews, that it was not written by one hand; for ſome places are writ in a ſhort compendious Stile, full of <hi>Ellipſes,</hi> and others in a looſe redundant one. But this Objection ſoon vaniſhes, if we conſider, that the variety we find in theſe Volumes, is rather to be aſcribed to the unrefin'd Condition of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, than any diverſity of Writers. Others object, That <hi>Moſes</hi> never ſpeaks of himſelf in the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> in the firſt Perſon, but that all his Actions and Speeches are related in the third; but theſe People are eaſily confuted by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Xenophon, Coeſar</hi> and <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and other Hiſtorians of the firſt Claſs, who whenever they have occaſion to ſpeak of themſelves, alway do it in the third Perſon.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:58698:62"/>
            <p>But 'tis not ſo eaſie to ſolve ſome Arguments, that are drawn from ſeveral places of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch,</hi> although ſome of them I muſt own are trivial enough, as will appear by examining them. In the firſt place they object that paſſage in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The name of the firſt is</hi> Piſon, <hi>that is it which compaſſeth the whole Land of</hi> Havilah, <hi>where there is Gold, and the Gold of that Land is good; there is</hi> Bdellium, <hi>and the Onyx-ſtone.</hi> Now this they ſay was written by one that lived in <hi>Chaldea</hi> becauſe <hi>Piſon,</hi> as they imagine, is a branch of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which after it has waſhed <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> falls into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf; and then the Geography of theſe Countries, according to them, does not ſeem to be ſo well known in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, that ſo particular an account could be given of them, eſpecially if we conſider at what a great diſtance they lay. But we have ſhown that the Country of<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Bochart,</hi> l. 5. c. 5. <hi>Hieroz.</hi> Part 2. ſuppoſes the Land of <hi>Havilan</hi> to be that part of <hi>Arabia</hi> near <hi>Catipha</hi> and <hi>Bahare,</hi> where precious Stones are dug up; and the <hi>Piſon</hi> to be that Branch of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which <hi>Petrus Texeira,</hi> an Eye-witneſs, affirms to fall into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ph at <hi>Catipha</hi> near <hi>Bahare.</hi> But our Author places <hi>Havilah</hi> nearer to <hi>Judea,</hi> not far from <hi>Coeleſyria.</hi> In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Saul</hi> is ſaid to have deſtroy'd the <hi>Amalekites</hi> with Fire and Sword, <hi>from</hi> Havilah <hi>until thou comeſt to</hi> Sur, <hi>that is over againſt Egypt.</hi> Now who can believe that <hi>Saul</hi> marched with his Forces an hundred and fifty <hi>German</hi> Miles, (for ſo much 'tis at leaſt, from the Frontier of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Havilah,</hi> in <hi>Bochart</hi>'s own Tables) eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he conſiders how deſtitute of all Proviſions <hi>Arabia Deſerta</hi> was, and that <hi>Saul</hi>'s Army conſiſted of 200000 fighting Men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if <hi>Havilah</hi> had been more remote than <hi>Sur,</hi> the Sacred Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian would not have ſaid, that <hi>Saul</hi> waſted the Country of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites</hi> from <hi>Havilah</hi> to <hi>Sur,</hi> but from <hi>Sur</hi> to <hi>Havilah.</hi> Therefore <hi>Sur</hi> and <hi>Havilah</hi> he concludes to be the Borders of thoſe People, the former to the South, and the latter to the North. As for the <hi>Piſon,</hi> he is of opinion that ſome Footſteps of it are to be found in <hi>Chryſorrhous,</hi> which riſes near the City of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it with Water, and is in a manner wholly loſt in ſeveral little Streams, as <hi>Strabo,</hi> l. 16. and <hi>Pliny,</hi> l. 5. c. 18. tell us. <hi>Petrus Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> Obſervat. l. 2. c. 91. ſays, That <hi>Damaſcus</hi> is ſo abundantly furniſh'd with Water from this River, that not only every private Houſe, but every Garden has a Fountain out of it. Now this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription admirably agrees with the Hebrew word <hi>Phiſon,</hi> which is derived from the Hebrew Root <hi>Phaſha, diffuſus fuit.</hi> The Greeks called it <hi>Chryſorrhoas,</hi> becauſe of the Gold Sands found in it, which <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us was very good in the Land of <hi>Havilah.</hi> For the ſame reaſon <hi>Pactolus,</hi> a River of <hi>Lydia,</hi> bore the ſame name.</note> 
               <hi>Havilah</hi> was nearer to <hi>Judea,</hi> and that (b) <hi>Piſon</hi> was perhaps the <hi>Chryſorrhoas</hi> that runs by <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> But ſuppoſing <hi>Chaldea</hi> is here meant, yet by reaſon of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that traffick'd from thence into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that Country might very well be known; for if in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time Caravans of Merchants tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled from <hi>Gilead</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> why might they not likewiſe come from <hi>Chaldea</hi> too thither?</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:58698:63"/>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame is ſuſpected of Chap. 10.8. and the following Verſes, where a larger account is given of <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his Empire, than there is of any other Heads of Families and Countries; and this they imagine might be ſaid more agreeably after the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, than before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had any manner of Commerce with thoſe People. But the mighty Reputation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the other Cities there mention'd, ſeem to afford ſufficient Cauſe, why <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould write a little more particularly about their Beginnings, who otherwiſe of himſelf, is apt enough to make ſuch Diſcoveries of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58698:63"/>Antiquity. As we have frequently<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Thus in the 35th Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> v. 8. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us why the Oak, under which <hi>Rebecca</hi>'s Nurſe was buried, was called <hi>Allon-bachouth,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Oak of Weeping;</hi> not that this Circumſtance was of greater moment than ſeveral others which he omits, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s coming home to his Parents, <hi>Rebecca</hi>'s death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only becauſe he had a mind to acquaint his Reader, why this Oak, which laſted to his own time, was called ſo. 'Tis not the moſt unuſeful part of an Antiquary's Buſineſs, to give the Original of Names. Hence it is that we have an account of the name of <hi>Babil,</hi> Chap. 11.9. of <hi>Zoar,</hi> Chap. 19.22. of <hi>Bethel,</hi> Chap. 28.9.

            <p>As for what concerns the name of <hi>Nineve,</hi> which ſeems to be of a later date than <hi>Moſes,</hi> as deriving its name from <hi>Ninus</hi> the Son of <hi>Belus,</hi> who according to the exacteſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chronology, flouriſh'd about the time of <hi>Deborah,</hi> perhaps the Original of it was otherwiſe than is commonly related.

            <p n="4">4. In Chap. 13.8. we meet with the word <hi>Hebron,</hi> by which name that Town did not go till after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, as appears from <hi>Joſhua</hi> 14.15. Chap. 15.13. where it is ſaid to have changed its old name <hi>Arba</hi> in the days of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua;</hi> and indeed that City ſeems to derive its name <hi>Hebron</hi> from the Nephew of <hi>Caleb.</hi> But Learned Men have rightly obſerved, that this paſſage might be added by another hand ſince the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to expound an obſcure Name by one that was better known.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58698:65"/>Sacrifice, has the following words, Chap. 22.14. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>called the name of that place</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah-jireh, <hi>as it is ſaid to this day, in the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen.</hi> Some are of opinion, that this was the Mountain <hi>Moria</hi> upon which the Temple was built, and which did not go by that name till the Temple was erected upon it. But this is a meer Conjecture, and although <hi>Moriah</hi> and <hi>Jehovah-Jireh</hi> ſeem to ſignifie the ſame thing, yet it does not follow from thence that 'tis but one name. With no greater reaſon on their ſide do others obſerve, that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be the Author of that Proverbial Saying (for ſo they call it) <hi>Proſpicietur in monte Jehovae,</hi> ſince the Perſon that added it to the Text, ſeems to ſpeak of it as if it were ſtill uſed in his time. But why might not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay, that this Proverb was in uſe <hi>etiamnum hodie,</hi> ſince perhaps this Form was uſed, from the days of <hi>Abraham</hi> down to <hi>Moſes.</hi> This I am certain of, that there is nothing in the whole Matter, which does not fitly agree with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time. There was a convenient diſtance enough between <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the latter to take notice, that the aforeſaid Form, of which <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Author, continued till his own time. Nay, if the Interval had not been quite ſo great, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> might very warrantably expreſs himſelf after that manner, ſince this Form is ſometimes uſed by thoſe that writ but a few years after, of which we

But we
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58698:67"/>have<note n="(h)" place="bottom">'Tis plain enough, ſays our Author upon this place, that after <hi>Joſhua</hi> had led the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> all that Country might be called, and really was called, <hi>the Land of the Hebrews:</hi> But if we ſhould take it in this Sence, it would follow that this Paſſage was written after the time of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as ſome have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.

For though they were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and wandered from one place to another, yet thoſe Fields might properly enough be ſaid to belong to them, where they had pitch'd their Tents for ſeveral years, with the Conſent of the old Inhabitants.

In <hi>Exodus</hi> Chap. 6. after the Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian has inform'd us of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Pedigree, he thus goes on v. 26. <hi>Theſe are THAT</hi> Aaron <hi>and</hi> Moſes <hi>to whom the Lord ſaid, bring out the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>from the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>according to their Armies.

Now we do not urge the third Perſon here, ſay ſome, which 'tis plain ſeveral Hiſtorians have uſed, but the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Pronouns <hi>that</hi> and <hi>they,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> would ſcarce make uſe of while he was alive, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of himſelf. But we muſt here call to mind, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not only write to his own Age, wherein his Father and Grand-father were well known, but likewiſe to the following Ages, to whom he ſeems in this place to direct his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and not to his Contemporaries, who knew
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58698:67"/>all theſe Particulars well enough. It was of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence for them to know, that <hi>Aaron</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Moſes</hi> was deſcended from <hi>Levi,</hi> and that he was the firſt Head of the Sacerdotal Families; therefore it ought not to ſeem ſtrange to any one, that in this place <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are as it were pointed at, and their Genealogy ſhown to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of future Ages.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The words of <hi>Exodus</hi> 16.35. are alledged, which they pretend could not be written till after the death of <hi>Moſes. And the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did eat Manna forty years, until they came to a Land inhabited: They did eat Manna until they came unto the Borders of the Land of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.

            <p n="13">13. Some Perſons deny the following Verſe to belong to <hi>Moſes, But an Omer is the tenth part of an Ephah;</hi> becauſe when a Meaſure is in uſe, it is not cuſtomary to define it; and therefore
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58698:68"/>they believe that after the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into ſeveral Countries, and conſequently began to uſe the Meaſures of other Nations, this was purpoſely written, that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand which Meaſure was meant in this Hiſtory. The ſame is obſerved about their Money, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.47. Chap. 18.16. But it does not appear, that the Jews uſed any other Meaſures in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> ſo as to make it neceſſary to define the old Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; nor does an <hi>Ephah</hi> ſeem to be better known than an <hi>Omer.</hi> But <hi>Moſes,</hi> who inſtituted the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Commonwealth, might deſignedly give a ſhort Deſcription of the Coins and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to the end that they might not afterwards be changed.</p>

            <p n="15">15. In the ſame Book Chap. 2.12. there are ſome words which they pretend could never come from <hi>Moſes, The</hi> Horims <hi>dwelt in</hi> Sur <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time, but the Children of</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="16">16. Chap. 3.11. Thus the Sacred Writer ſpeaks of the King of <hi>Baſan. For only</hi> Og <hi>King of</hi> Baſan <hi>remain'd of the remnant of Giants, behold his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted was a Bedſted of Iron: Is it not in</hi> Rabbah <hi>of the Children of</hi> Ammon? <hi>Nine Cubits was the length thereof, and four Cubits the breadth of it.</hi> Now ſome can ſcarce believe, that it was poſſible for <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak thus of a Man that was lately dead, and overcome by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and whoſe Bed was rather in <hi>Baſan,</hi> of which Territory he was King, than among the <hi>Ammonites</hi> who were none of his Subjects. But <hi>Moſes</hi> had a mind to give a particular account of a thing, which was well known at that time indeed, but would have been unknown to Poſterity, unleſs he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it in writing. As for what concerns the Bed, how it came to be carried into another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who can tell? But ſince there is no Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in this Story, nothing can be gather'd from a thing, the reaſon of which is altogether unknown.</p>
            <p n="17">17. In the ſame Chapter, v. 14. we meet with the following paſſage, Jair <hi>the Son of</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>took all the Country of</hi> Argob <hi>unto the Coaſts of</hi> Geſhuri <hi>and</hi> Maacathi, <hi>and call'd them after his own name</hi> Baſhan-Havoth-jair <hi>unto this day.</hi> We ſhall handle this matter more at large in our Commentary. In the mean time if this were added by a later hand, yet it would not follow
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58698:69"/>from thence, that the greateſt part of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi> was not written by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. We will not deny the laſt Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> to be writ by ſome one elſe, where <hi>Moſes</hi>'s going up to Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and his death, are related, and yet all the foregoing Chapters are not therefore to be given away from him. We may eaſily ſuppoſe that this Book was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by another hand, which had been in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imperfect, if it had not ended with the death of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But thoſe Jews that are of opinion, that <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold all theſe things, as being aſſiſted by a Prophetical Spirit, do not deſerve to be heard. What can be ſaid more plainly, to make us underſtand that theſe things were written long after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s death, than what we find in the three laſt Verſes?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Hence we may gather from theſe eighteen places, which are commonly brought to prove the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> to be of a later date, that moſt of them are doubtful, and conſequently ought not to be made uſe of as Arguments to prove theſe five Books to belong to another Age. Very few of them manifeſtly ſeem to be added by another hand, and do not in the leaſt hinder, why we ſhould not aſcribe theſe Volumes to <hi>Moſes.</hi> After the ſame manner, ſome ancient Grammarians tell us, there are ſeveral Verſes here and there inſerted into <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poems, yet no one from thence takes occaſion to deny that the <hi>Iliads</hi> and the <hi>Odyſſes</hi> were written by <hi>Homer.</hi> We muſt not imagine that in former Ages they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58698:69"/>had ſuch plenty of Books, or ſo many Copies of the ſame Book as now we have; and ſo it might eaſily happen, that in ſucceeding Times one of the Prophets might make ſome Additions to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which afterwards were incorporated with all the Copies.</p>
            <p>Indeed if it did not otherwiſe evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the greateſt part by far of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi> was written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> I confeſs there would be great weight in the above-mention'd Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to incline us to believe that theſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes were written much later than is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended; but ſince we have proved it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all manner of doubt, that almoſt all the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> belongs to <hi>Moſes,</hi> we have no reaſon to aſcribe thoſe Books to any one but him.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It has been long controverted among Learned Men, who it was that made theſe Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we find in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and they have gone upon various Conjectures. Some would have him to be <hi>Joſhua,</hi> others <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and laſtly, others to be the under Scribe among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but this is only gueſſing, for they bring no Reaſons to enforce their Opinions. Becauſe <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Moſes,</hi> therefore ſome People fancy it was he that inſerted thoſe Paſſages that ſeem to carry Diſcoveries of a later Age. Again, others aſcribe this to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> who is, by the Jews, ſaid to have regulated the Sacred Volumes, and by ſome, to have made them up again out of his Memory after they were certainly loſt. But ſince theſe different Hypotheſes are ſupported
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58698:70"/>by no competent Witneſſes, that is to ſay, ſuch as flouriſhed in the ſame Times, or ſuch as might have learn'd the Truth out of the Memoirs of their Contemporaries, they may be as eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as they are brought upon the Stage. Nor is a multitude of Authors, who lived ſeveral Ages after, and never cite any that are older than themſelves, and who do but tranſcribe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of any weight. <hi>Eſdras</hi> is only called <hi>a Scribe,</hi> and <hi>a ready Scribe in the Law of</hi> Moſes, in thoſe Books that go under his Name. See chiefly the ſeventh Chapter of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and this ſeems to have given occaſion to that Fable, of his reſtoring the Sacred Books; though <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> rather ſignifies a Learned Man, as we might eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, than one that is buſied in tranſcribing of Books. Several uncertain things have been poſitively aſſerted concerning theſe <hi>under Scribes,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew at a more proper place upon the following Books, but this is the moſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all, <hi>viz.</hi> That they inſerted the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Additions into the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Volumes.</p>
            <p>And therefore after a diligent Examination of the Matter, we ingenuouſly own that here we do not know what to conclude; perhaps one of thoſe who are already ſuppoſed, perhaps ſome one elſe, and perhaps ſeveral hands have at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times inſerted theſe things into <hi>Moſes.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can have no ſurer or ſafer Sanctuary here, than prudently to ſuſpend our Judgments; by which conduct, if we do not diſcover the Truth, yet at leaſt it is not excluded from the Mind.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:58698:70"/>
            <p n="6">VI. If we were able to diſcover all the Deſigns that <hi>Moſes</hi> propoſed to himſelf in writing, this would be of much greater Importance towards the better Interpretation of his Volumes; for theſe Books are not like the Works of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, where we find nothing but general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that have a relation neither to certain Places, nor Times, nor Men, and do not allude to any thing but the buſineſs in hand. <hi>Moſes</hi> writ for the Benefit and Inſtruction of a particular People called the <hi>Jews,</hi> though I do not deny that by the means of Divine Providence, his Books were afterwards ſerviceable to innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other Nations. Upon this account he ſaid abundance of things merely for the uſe of that People, which he had omitted, if he had not been influenced by this Conſideration. He likewiſe had an Eye to the Opinions and Cuſtoms of the neighbouring Nations, which he aſſented to, or rejected, according as they agreed with Reaſon and the Truth.</p>
            <p>We know indeed, from the nature of the thing it ſelf, that the general aim of his writing, was to teach the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the Worſhip of one God, and to deliver them the Laws which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him; but it is to be wiſhed, that we particularly knew for what Reaſons he followed one certain Method in Writing more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what he chiefly had an eye to in that Abridgment of the ancient Hiſtory which he has left behind him. From hence perhaps we might be able to comprehend why he omits ſeveral
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58698:71"/>Tranſactions, to give us a Narration of ſome other Events, which are not, as we imagine, of ſo great Importance; why he uſed ſuch and ſuch Words and Expreſſions, why he mentions ſome things only <hi>en paſſant,</hi> and treats of others in a more copious and frequent manner; with other things of the ſame nature, which would give conſiderable light to many obſcure places.</p>
            <p>Were it poſſible for any one ſo to ſecure his Readers, before they were admitted to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they ſhould find no rugged places, or at leaſt but few, that were hard to be underſtood; ſo univerſal an Obligation could never be requited with Thanks and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations enough. For Example, No one reads the ſhort <hi>Prologomena</hi> which <hi>Aſconius Pedianus</hi> has given us, before ſome of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Orations againſt <hi>Verres,</hi> but he would with all his heart be at any Expence, that all the reſt of his Orations were recommended and illuſtrated by ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces. For thoſe Prefaces or Arguments are no ſmall helps towards the underſtanding of <hi>Tully,</hi> and would be infinitely more ſerviceable to the World, if they were but longer.</p>
            <p>Now ſince we are deſtitute of ſuch Aſſiſtances, by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory, and the great Scarcity of ancient Oriental Authors, and can by no means ſupply the Defect of thoſe things which are neceſſary to ſuch a Deſign, it remains that we muſt often be involv'd in the greateſt Difficulties. And as I often conſidered of this Matter, when I had the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Writings in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58698:71"/>my hands, ſo I was reſolved to collect and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, whatever might be pertinently ſaid upon this occaſion. I flatter'd my ſelf that I ſhould not be ſo rigorouſly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, if I did not anſwer the Reader's Expectation, as if I only raiſed his Appetite, and did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſatisfie him; for this reaſon I made no ſcruple to ſet what follows before my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, whatever the Learned World may think of it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That no body may miſtake me, or expect to find what I never promiſed, I do not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, or rather God's Intention in delivering the Law, which we ſhall conſider when we come to the particular Laws, but what was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s chief and principal aim, in writing and publiſhing the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> ſuch as we now have it. All Men, as we obſerved before, know well enough that <hi>Moſes</hi> chiefly writ to teach the People of the Jews, that only one God was to be worſhipped, and after what manner that was to be done; but we muſt more diſtinctly ſhew, what method he took to reach that mark, (if I may be allow'd ſo to expreſs my ſelf) and what other ends he might poſſibly have.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt chiefly, and in the firſt place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it never was in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s thoughts, to write the Annals of all Mankind down to his own time; but only to ſelect thoſe Paſſages out of the Hiſtories of former Ages, which agreed with his general Deſign before mention'd, or ſome other particular by ends. Hence we find
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58698:72"/>that nothing can be ſhorter than his Hiſtory is, from the Creation of the World to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſince 'tis diſpatch'd in the firſt eleven Chapters, which make up about one fifth part of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and yet the Hiſtory before <hi>Abraham</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes above two thouſand years, but from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to the death of <hi>Joſeph</hi> where the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> ends, 'tis not quite three hundred years.</p>
            <p>Nay, out of this General Hiſtory of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years and upwards, he only ſelects a few things, that were either neceſſary to the Series and Order of the following Tranſactions, or might ſerve to inſtruct the Minds of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> in Piety and Vertue. And this is the reaſon why he omits an infinite number of things, which the Curioſity of the Reader would be apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a <hi>detail</hi> of, and only preſents us with a naked Chronology of the firſt Times. However he occaſionally ſprinkles ſome things, which he imagined might more eaſily induce the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to obſerve the Law, and therefore not only tells them that the World was created, and that it was made in the compaſs of ſix days, but that God reſted on the<note n="(i)" place="bottom">The Learned Maſter of the <hi>Charter-houſe</hi> to his <hi>Archaologie</hi> has explained himſelf much to the ſame purpoſe, as M. <hi>is Clerk</hi> does here in this Paragraph.</note> Seventh, as we find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. (becauſe this day was to be kept Holy, and 'twas chiefly celebrated in the Law in remembrance of the Creation) that the Jews might underſtand why they were ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly commanded to reſt on that day. For the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58698:72"/>ſame reaſon, Chap. 1.14. <hi>Moſes,</hi> where he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the ſeveral uſes that are made of the Sun and Moon's motion, obſerves by the by that they ſhewed <hi>Seaſons</hi> or ſolemn Feſtivals. When he might have contracted the Hiſtory of the firſt Sin, as he does many more, and only ſaid that our firſt Parents were not in all reſpects obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to God, for which reaſon he inflicted upon them all thoſe Evils that now viſit Mankind, he choſe perhaps to enlarge more copiouſly upon it in the third Chapter, becauſe it might be uſeful for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were commanded to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from ſeveral Animals and Fruits, to know, that the firſt Sin proceeded from Intemperance; that ſo this Example might deter them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeduced with the outward Appearance of any prohibited Fleſh or Fruit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Deſign was, to write the Hiſtory of the Jewiſh Nation from its firſt Founder <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who was commanded by God to go out of <hi>Chaldaea</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and in Truth the Original of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is to be ſought. For while <hi>Abraham</hi> was beyond the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he liv'd among the other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but in <hi>Canaan,</hi> living apart from all the reſt, he did in ſome manner repreſent a particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Family. This is the reaſon why <hi>Moſes,</hi> from that time, omits all other Nations, and only ſpeaks of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity, although no queſtion is to be made, but that innumerable Events worthy of remembrance happen'd in other Kingdoms. As for inſtance, It had been
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58698:73"/>worthy the relating, what ſort of a Prieſthood that of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was, and how he maintain'd the Worſhip of the High God among a People that were abandoned to Idolatry. Nevertheleſs becauſe theſe things related to the Hiſtory of another Nation <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſtill keeps to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, omits them. From hence we may learn by the bye, that we muſt not always draw an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Silence; and that for inſtance, we cannot, affirm that all other Nations were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by God Almighty, merely becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays nothing of God's Favours to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſeems likewiſe to have deſign'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Manners of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> not only by direct and open Precepts, but by a more oblique<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Thus our Author ſuppoſes, that to diſſuade the Jews from taking to themſelves Wives out of a ſtrange Nation, he let them ſee, how Fatal to the Sons of <hi>Seth</hi> their Marriages with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Cain</hi> proved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2.</note> way, of inſtructing them by Narrations. It was a common Cuſtom with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to caſt off their Wives at pleaſure, which by reaſon of the Hardneſs of their Hearts, he would not abſolutely forbid, but hints to them, That <hi>it was not ſo from the beginning; and that whoever could receive this ſaying might. Therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a Man ſhall leave his Father and his Mother, and ſhall cleave to his Wife, and they twain ſhall be one Fleſh,</hi> Chap. 2.24. Compare our Saviour's words, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.4, &amp;c. with theſe.</p>
            <p>Polygamy too was in Faſhion among them, which he could not openly attack, without
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58698:73"/>alienating the Hearts of all the People from him. However in that compendious Hiſtory of the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Ages, eſpecially where he mentions the Poſterity of <hi>Cain,</hi> he judg'd it <hi>à propos,</hi> not to omit Chap. 4. that the firſt Inſtance of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy</hi> was in that Generation, and privately Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates, that <hi>Lamech,</hi> who firſt aſſum'd that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, was of a fierce Diſpoſition, and deſpiſed his other Wives, as appears by his Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> endeavours, in this Hiſtory, to raiſe an Averſion in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the Fables of their Neighbours, and conſequently to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which for the moſt part was built upon them; and this ſeems probable for the following Reaſons: He not only teaches, that the World was created, which the neighbouring Nations ſeem to have believed, or rather knew it, from ancient Monuments; but he likewiſe ſhews how many <hi>Generations</hi> there were from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World down to his own time, and reckons every particular Perſon ſo <hi>generated,</hi> to oppoſe the Truth to that mighty number of <hi>Generations,</hi> which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> pretended to have been in their own Country. For not to mention what the Learned Sir <hi>John Marſham</hi> has collected relating to this Head, <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who lived about the middle of the Fourth Chiliad of the World, according to the Computation of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> tells us in his Second Book, Chap. 142. that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> pretended, after the Gods had ceaſed to reign in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that there reach'd to his Age three hundred forty five Generations, which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58698:74"/>make up Ten thouſand four hundred ſeventy three years. See the Boaſting of the <hi>Egyptians, Ezek.</hi> 29.3. and our Annotations upon <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> 13.23. But <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.6. that after the Flood, <hi>Egypt</hi> was Peopled by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Cham,</hi> who came thither out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> too Romanced very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Generation of Men in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and about the Flood, which may be found in <hi>Diodorus,</hi> L. 1.

Thus <hi>Cain,</hi> the Firſt-born, was not ſo acceptable to God, as his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel,</hi> and at laſt loſt the Privileges of Primogeniture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Shem</hi> ſeems to be preferr'd to <hi>Japhet, Gen.</hi> 5. &amp; 9. <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Haran, Gen.</hi> 11. <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Iſhmael, Gen.</hi> 17. and <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſet before <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Amongſt the Sons of <hi>Jacob, Reuben</hi> loſes his Birth-right, which was partly conferred upon <hi>Judah,</hi> and partly upon <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s younger Son is preferred to the Elder. If it were lawful for us to interpoſe our own Conjectures, continues he, we might with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability enough, ſuppoſe that the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites, Iſhmaelites</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> who were all deſcended from the eldeſt Sons, did, upon that Score, claim a Right over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> where they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be more Powerful than them: For which reaſon <hi>Moſes,</hi> who writ chiefly for the ſake of the Jews, often took notice, that the elder Brothers were, not without good cauſe, Poſtpon'd to the younger: Nay, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, who was the younger of the two, was preferr'd to his Brother <hi>Aaron, Non ſine aliquâ fratris inpidiâ,</hi> Numb. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.19. therefore it is highly Credible, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had a mind to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Pride of the neighbouring Nations, and furniſh the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with ſome Topicks to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid them with.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly, While he writes the Hiſtory of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> although 'tis true he enlarges more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly upon their Affairs, yet we muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (and the Brevity of it is a convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what I here maintain,) that he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to write full Annals. It appears from the Sacred Hiſtory it ſelf, that ſeveral things are omitted by him, which however are told in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, though they had no relation to it. He ſays nothing of the Idolatry of the Anceſtors of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were beyond the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:58698:76"/>of which <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.2. makes mention, unleſs perhaps it is obſcurely hinted at in <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.53. He is utterly ſilent of the Idolatry of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which nevertheleſs <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Prophet lays to their Charge, Chap. 20.7, 8. He has likewiſe omitted a particular ſort of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, into which they fell when they were in the Wilderneſs, of which <hi>Amos</hi> 5.25, 26. gives us an account. But for what reaſons, we are wholly in the dark.</p>
            <p>But ſince by theſe Examples, and indeed by the Work it ſelf, 'tis evident that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not write Annals, we muſt leſs admire to ſee him neglect the order of Time, which ought to be obſerv'd in a larger Hiſtory. For 'tis well known, that in ſuch ſorts of Hiſtories, as Lives are, the true Series of things is never accurately kept, as we find in the moſt celebrated Biographers of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins, Plutarch, Diogenes, Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Corn.

                  <hi>I.</hi> How differently Interpreters have explained this Hiſtory: Some affirm that it was a real Serpent. <hi>II.</hi> Others look upon the whole to be Allegorical; or, <hi>III.</hi> Pretend that the Devil was ſignified by that Name: Or, <hi>IV.</hi> That he informed the body of a Serpent. <hi>V.</hi> That the manner how Sin entered into the World cannot certainly be known. <hi>VI.</hi> Another Explication of this Paſſage. <hi>VII.</hi> Why the Serpent is called <hi>Subtle.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">I. SOME of the Ancient Jews are of Opinion, that the whole paſſage in <hi>Moſes</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a real Serpent, which Creature they imagine to have formerly had the Gift of Speech, ſo that <hi>Eve</hi> might very well underſtand him. <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the firſt Book of his Antiquities, <hi>c.</hi> 1. pretends, that at that time <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>all Creatures uſing the ſame Language,</hi> and conſequently being indued with Reaſon and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58698:77"/>Underſtanding, the Serpent, incited by Envy, tempted <hi>Eve</hi> to Sin, and among other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this ſignal Puniſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould be deprived of his Feet, and ever after crawl upon the Ground. <hi>Aben ezra,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Rabbins,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this place after the ſame manner. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my ſelf impartially, If <hi>Moſes</hi> had been of this Opinion, he could not have ſpoken more plainly to the purpoſe, than now he does: For in the firſt place, he deſcribes the Serpent to have been the moſt Subtle of all Creatures: Next, That he employ'd his Subtlety in Deceiving our Firſt Parent, and held a Dialogue with her, as if he had been a Maſter of Reaſoning. Laſtly, That his creeping upon his Belly was impoſed upon him as a Puniſhment. <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf could not have more fully explained his Sentiments, than <hi>Moſes</hi> has done.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But other Perſons, who were <hi>Jews</hi> likewiſe, not being able to digeſt ſo many unpalatable things, as Speech and Reaſon attributed to a Brute, and the Serpent's loſing his Feet, although <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeem'd to expreſs as much in the plaineſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imaginable, yet rather than underſtand him ſo, they choſe to commit Violence upon his words, and betake themſelves to Allegory. <hi>Philo</hi> indeed, in his Treatiſe <hi>De mundi opificio,</hi> and elſewhere, denies that theſe <hi>were Fables and Fictions, wherein the Poets and Sophiſters take ſo great a delight.</hi> Nevertheleſs he owns them to be <hi>Figurative Documents, that are to be explain'd Allegorically, in order to find out the bidden meaning of them.</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:58698:78"/>And laſtly affirms, That it may be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that the Serpent is a Symbol of Pleaſure, which Argument he handles more copiouſly afterwards. <hi>Maimonides</hi> alſo Part 2. <hi>Mor. Nev.</hi> c. 29. ſuppoſes, that theſe Paſſages are to be expounded by way of Allegory, and ſome of the later <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> declare themſelves to be of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But others that have a juſt Indignation to this Libertine way of Interpreting the Scripture, which wholly depends upon the Fancy of the Interpreter, and yet not able with <hi>Joſephus</hi> to follow the literal Senſe, have fallen into different Sentiments, none of which labours with fewer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences than the two above-cited Opinions. Some Divines of no mean Rank in the Learned World, maintain, that it was not a Serpent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, which appeared, but that the Devil was ſignified by that name, that therefore the Devil is called the old Serpent by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and is thus deſcribed by St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 12.9. <hi>The great Dragon the old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, who ſeduceth all the Earth.</hi> See likewiſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2. For this Reaſon the Devil is called by our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>a Murderer from the Beginning.</hi> And the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> 2.24. tells us, That <hi>Death entered into the World by the Envy of the Devil.</hi> See alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. where the Serpent is ſaid <hi>to have deceived the Woman by his Subtilty.</hi> But this Hypotheſis is eaſily refuted; for neither can the Devil be called <hi>the moſt ſubtle Beaſt of the Field,</hi> but in a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58698:78"/>Figurative Senſe; neither will the Puniſhment inflicted upon the Serpent, ſuffer us to doubt, that a Serpent's Body at leaſt appear'd here. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move theſe Difficulties ſome conjecture, that the Devil did not put on a real Serpent, but only formed the Exterior Appearance of one. But the above-mention'd Objections are as directly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd againſt this Opinion as the former.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. For this reaſon ſeveral Perſons have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the Devil uſed the Serpent's body as an Organ to act his Impoſture by, and that God, to ſhew his utter Averſion and Hatred of Sin, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the very Organ by which this Seduction was effected. But if it were ſo, what occaſion was there to ſay, that the Serpent was the moſt ſubtle Beaſt of the Field. For the Devil might have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the moſt ſtupid Creature in the World to this purpoſe with as much Succeſs; for he did not employ the Serpent's Craft, but his own, to deceive <hi>Eve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. But others obſerving theſe and the like Difficulties in all theſe Opinions, came at laſt to this Point, as to own, that all we could apparently gather from this <hi>Aenigma,</hi> was, that the Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Mankind began to Sin, from whence a Series of innumerable Evils were derived to them and their Poſterity. 'Tis indeed certain, that now and heretofore Mankind has been in a State of great Corruption, nor can the beginning of this Infection be carried lower than the Original of the World. But then after what manner Sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the World, ſo that we might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58698:79"/>plainly, and without the leaſt Reaſons of doubting, all the Circumſtances of the firſt Sin, none but thoſe can ſignifie to us, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the matter, if by any means they could be revived again.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Laſtly, Others finding in this Hiſtory, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention made of Diſcourſes, where none at all ſeem to have paſſed, imagine, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent did not ſpeak, but that <hi>Eve</hi> ſaw him eating the Forbidden Fruit, and was ſeduced, by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to eat of it her ſelf. Eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this prohibited Fruit, by its beauty, and perhaps by the ſpecious name of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> might help to induce her, as ſhe was gazing on it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Serpent's Puniſhment, below v. 14. <hi>Thou ſhalt lick the Duſt all the days of thy Life,</hi> ſeems to intimate, that the Serpent had deceived <hi>Eve</hi> by eating of the Fruit, and becauſe he had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned her Ruine by eating of Fruit from a high Tree, therefore he was condemn'd to lick the Juices of the Earth. The Favourers of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion do not deny, but that ſome Evil Spirit might act his part in this Tragedy, for which reaſon the <hi>Jews</hi> not rightly comprehending the meaning of this place, might in after-Ages call him by the name of the <hi>Serpent.</hi> But as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtorian introduces the Serpent Speaking, who had no Speech at all, according to the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of his Narration, as is plain from the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where he frequently repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents God Almighty ſpeaking to all the parts of the Creation; ſo likewiſe becauſe he was to give
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58698:79"/>him his ſhare in a Dialogue, by whoſe Example our firſt Parents were deceived, he therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes Subtlety to him, which however can be ſuppoſed to belong to a Beaſt, no more than the Faculty of Speaking does. For this reaſon he is ſaid to have uſed both Speech and Craftineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as the Maintainers of this Opinion alledge, he as effectually ruined our firſt Parents, as if he had ſeduced them by a crafty artificial Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue. And therefore both the Subtlety of the Serpent, and his Converſation with <hi>Eve,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by them, not as Circumſtances that can be urged, but as ſome Oriental Ornaments of the Hiſtory. This was in part the Opinion of <hi>Iſaac Abarbinel,</hi> who denies that the Serpent could maintain any Diſcourſes with <hi>Eve,</hi> and aſſerts, That nothing more is meant by this Colloquy, but <hi>the Reaſonings of the Woman from what ſhe gathered from the Serpents action, and his eating of that Tree.</hi> He pretends, that ſhe inferr'd from the Serpent's Example, that the Forbidden Fruit was Wholeſome and Nutritive, which Opinion does not well agree with the words, <hi>You ſhall be like Gods;</hi> the meaning of which could never be deduced from this ſingle action of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>In ſo perplex'd and obſcure a Matter as this is, 'tis the ſafeſt way, as I imagine, openly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Ignorance, provided we ſtill preſerve the Subſtance of the Hiſtory, as 'tis explain'd in the fifth Opinion, but ſo as not to condemn thoſe that differ from our Sentiments. We are now
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58698:80"/>at liberty to examine more at large the moſt remarkeble Particulars of this Relation.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. We find in the Sacred Writer, that the Serpent was the moſt Subtle of the Beaſts of the Field Now ſome are apt to believe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Paſſage had a Reſpect to the Craft of the Devil, who either appeared himſelf, or actually entered into the Body of the Serpent. But what wonder is it, that the Devil ſhould be more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than a Beaſt? And Secondly, How comes he to be reckoned among the Beaſts of the Field? Therefore others conjecture, That the Craftineſs of Serpents properly ſo called is here meant, and to this purpoſe obſerve, That as they lie hid in the Duſt, or under the Herbs, they uſe to bite the heels of the Animals that paſs by: For which reaſon <hi>Ariſtotle Hist. Animal.</hi> l. 1. c. 1. ranks them among the inſidious and wily Creatures, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> going about to relate the Fall of our firſt Parents, which was occaſioned by the Serpent, after what manner ſoever it happened, very pertinently obſerves, that the Serpent is an inſidious Animal, and indeed we find the Hebrew word, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.22. applied to Men lying in wait, and ſtarting out of Holes. Otherwiſe, as for what regards Subtlety conſidered in general, there are ſeveral other Animals more cunning than a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, among which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reckons Foxes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Others are cunning and miſchievous as Foxes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that hold this Narration to be wholly Figurative, pretend that <hi>Moſes</hi> prudently makes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58698:80"/>mention of the inſidious nature of the Serpent, to prepare his Reader for what he was going to tell him, of the Fall of our firſt Parents. Thus the moſt ancient Philoſophers, both <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> and <hi>Graecians,</hi> who uſed to deal in Apologues borrow'd from Brutes, if they are to ſpeak concerning Craft, were wont to introduce a <hi>Fox,</hi> and to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him in the beginning, as the <hi>moſt Cunning of Beaſts,</hi> or elſe gave ſome by-hints of his Subtlety. Thus we find in <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> that,
<q>Doloſa vulpes avidis rapuit dentibus.</q>
               <q>The <hi>Crafty</hi> Fox with greedy Teeth devour'd.</q>
The ſame Creature is deſcribed by <hi>Avienus,</hi> as capable of acute Diſcourſe, and is called by him <hi>Arguta,</hi> in his Fable of the <hi>Fox and the Leopard.</hi> But as no one of tolerable Senſe, will infer from this, that the Fox is fitter to hold thoſe Politick Diſcourſes than any other Creature, ſo they ſay we lie under no Obligation to aſcribe that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which <hi>Joſephus</hi> erroneouſly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to him, <hi>viz.</hi> of aſſigning both Voice and Reaſon to Brutes.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Immediately upon eating the Forbidden Fruit, the Sacred Hiſtorian tells us, That our firſt Parents <hi>knew themſelves to be naked,</hi> that is, They were ſenſible they had tranſgreſſed. Thus in <hi>Exodus</hi> 32.25. after the Golden Calf was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to have ſeen <hi>the People naked;</hi> and in the New Teſtament, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is ſometimes taken for a Sinner, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58698:81"/>Thoſe that interpret <hi>naked</hi> in its proper Senſe, involve themſelves in inſuperable Difficulties. When <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were alone, they could no more be aſhamed of their Nakedneſs, or diſcover it if they knew nothing of it before, than when they were in the State of Innocence. But ſay others, The Fruit of this Forbidden Tree, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked them to Luſt, and ſome undecent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Body, which ſuppoſe to be true, (although 'tis a Conjecture without any manner of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,) what will they be able to gather from hence? Can a Man's Appetite towards his Wife be ſaid to be Vicious, which Nature it ſelf has implanted upon all Creatures, or could they be more aſhamed, becauſe being naked, they felt this Appetite after their Tranſgreſſion, more than they did before? When only they two inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the Univerſe, their Bed under the bare Canopy of the Heavens was equally as Chaſte, as if it had been covered with a Roof, and Wall, and Cieling, and Tapeſtry. 'Tis certain they could never be aſhamed of that thing for which they were created, no leſs than other Animals; neither are we at this day aſhamed of it, but before Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, for certain Inconveniencies, which would ariſe from thence, though it is not ſo convenient to mention them in this place. I know what ſeveral of the Ancients, as well as Moderns, have ſaid upon this occaſion, but they are ſuch groundleſs precarious things, that I will not ſtay to confute them.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:58698:81"/>
            <p n="9">IX. We are now arrived to the laſt part of our Diſquiſition, <hi>viz.</hi> The Puniſhment inflicted upon the Serpent, which we ſhall examine in as ſmall a compaſs as may be. Thoſe that affirm the Devil tempted <hi>Eve</hi> out of the Serpent's Mouth, do not at all wonder that God Almighty here is ſaid to ſpeak to the Serpent, that is, to the Devil. But others that deny the Serpent to have ever talked to <hi>Eve,</hi> are of opinion, that God's words here directed to the Serpent, were not for its own ſake, which as being deſtitute of reaſon it could not underſtand, but for the Comfort of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> However both are agreed in this. That God might puniſh the Inſtrument, by which Mankind was ſeduced, to expreſs his juſt Hatred of Sin; as we find a like inſtance in <hi>Exodus</hi> 21.28. where an Oxe that had goared a Man or a Woman, ſo that they died, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to be ſtoned, and his Fleſh not to be eaten.</hi> One part of the Malediction is, That he ſhould crawl upon his Belly, concerning which, there are two different Opinions. Some, in which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we find <hi>Joſephus</hi> and ſeveral of the Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> believe, that God deprived the Serpent of his Feet, and commanded him to creep upon the Duſt; and indeed if <hi>Moſes</hi> had this in his Thoughts, he could not have expreſs'd himſelf more plainly concerning it. But others believe it very improbable, that God ſhould make any Alteration in the Nature of a Serpent, merely for the Tranſgreſſion of Man, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that what was natural to him, turned to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58698:82"/>his Puniſhment, as Nakedneſs in a Man, and the Pains of Child-birth in a Woman. Indeed if Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents had Feet at any time, they muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity have more than four, by reaſon of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious length of their Body. But ſtill 'tis diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to comprehend, how a thing which was merely natural, and accompanied with no Pain, ſhould be turned into a Puniſhment. As 'tis no Puniſhment for four-footed Creatures that they cannot fly, no more is it to thoſe Reptiles that are deſtitute of Feet, to crawl upon their Bellies. Let the Reader examine which ſide has the feweſt Difficulties, and chuſe either this or that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as he ſees fit.</p>

               <hi>Diſſertation V.</hi> Concerning the Flood.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> The different Opinions about the Flood. <hi>II.</hi> Some bold it to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, and endeavour to prove it from the expreſs words of <hi>Moſes. III.</hi> Others make it particular: The Arguments alledged by them. <hi>IV.</hi> Their Anſwers to the Reaſons commonly urged by the Maintainers of the firſt Opinion.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">I. ALL Interpreters are agreed, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge was ſo far Univerſal, as it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd all the then inhabited part of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58698:82"/>World; and that all the Race of Mankind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family, were deſtroy'd by it. But ſome are of opinion, that the whole Globe of the Earth was cover'd with Water, which others again as poſitively deny.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They that hold the Affirmative, in the firſt place, ground themſelves upon the expreſs words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who introduces God laying his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon <hi>Noah,</hi> Chap. 6.19. <hi>of every living thing of all fleſh,</hi> to take two of every ſort into the Ark, to preſerve the ſeveral Species of them, leſt they ſhould be loſt. Which Command <hi>Noah</hi> accordingly obey'd, and taking Pairs of every Bird, every Beaſt, and every creeping thing upon the Earth, according to their ſeveral Kinds, placed them in the Ark. Now theſe Expreſſions denote, that all living Creatures whatever were to be deſtroy'd, for otherwiſe <hi>Noah</hi> might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited himſelf much eaſier out of ſome other Country where the Deluge did not reach, and conſequently where they were not deſtroy'd, than have kept them in the Ark, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more troubleſome. As for the Birds eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, there was no neceſſity to gather them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as they could have eaſily flown to the dry places, ſo after the Country that was overflow'd was dry again, they would have ſoon returned. Nay, it had been much more commodious for <hi>Noah</hi> to have gone to that part of the World which was not cover'd with Waters, than to be ſhut up ſo long in the Ark.</p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:58698:83"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the Species of all Animals are ſaid to be preſerved by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Care, ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> could not in more expreſs words have told us, that all the reſt over the face of the World were deſtroy'd, than in the following Lines, Chap. 7.21. <hi>All the fleſh died that moved upon the Earth, both of Fowl and of Cattle, and of Beaſt, and of every creeping thing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All in whoſe noſtrils was the Breath of Life, of all that was on the dry Land died. And every living Subſtance was deſtroyed, which was upon the face of the ground, both Man and Cattle, and the creeping things, and the Fowl of the Heaven.</hi> If a Man was never ſo much minded to tell his Reader, that all ſorts of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in all places were deſtroy'd, 'tis impoſſible to do it more plainly. How can the Birds of any one Country be ſuppoſed to be loſt, if they had the next Country to fly to, which was free from the Flood. Could not ſo much as one wild Beaſt ſave himſelf thither by flight?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are told in the eighth Chapter, that <hi>Noah</hi> ſtaid within the Ark till ſuch time as the Earth was dried, when it had been much more eaſie for him to have gone to ſome of thoſe Countries which had not been viſited by the Deluge; eſpecially, ſince the Soil of ſuch a place would have been much better for him upon all accounts, than that of a Country cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Salt Water. Nay, he might, as we obſerv'd before, have fled thither before the Flood, with his Family and all his Effects, and ſo have avoided the Fatigue and Trouble of building
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58698:83"/>an Ark, which employ'd him without queſtion a whole year.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The heighth of the Water ſhews, that the whole Terreſtrial Globe was covered; for ſince <hi>the higheſt Mountains under Heaven</hi> were covered fifteen Cubits, that is, two and twenty Foot high with Water, 'tis certain that no part of the Earth could eſcape the Flood; and ſo we find, that when the Waters began to decreaſe, the firſt place the Ark lighted upon, was on the higheſt ridge of the <hi>Gordiaean</hi> Mountains.</p>
            <p>'To theſe Reaſons, which are borrowed from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Narration, we will not add the general Conſent of ancient and modern Interpreters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all of them purely depend upon it. Now thoſe that are of Opinion that it was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Univerſal, than as it overflow'd ſo much of the World as was inhabited by Mankind, and deſtroy'd all Men but thoſe that eſcaped in the Ark, think they have defended their Hypotheſis with invincible Arguments, and in the next place have produced Anſwers to all the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Reaſons, which, to ſay the Truth, do not equal the Force of Arguments. After the ſame manner, thoſe that maintain that all the World was covered with the Flood, prove their Opinion out of Scripture, much better than they reſolve the Objections of their Adverſaries.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That only the inhabited part of the World ſuffer'd by the Flood, they think is manifeſt from hence, That ſince God Almighty only propoſed to deſtroy Mankind, there was no neceſſity for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58698:84"/>the Flood to reach farther than Men had planted themſelves. It is likewiſe paſt Diſpute, that he deſign'd to puniſh Men alone, becauſe Men alone are capable of Sin, in whoſe Deſtruction, if any Beaſts are involved, they periſhed for no other reaſon, but becauſe they happened to be in the ſame place where Men lived. Now before the Flood Mankind could not extend it ſelf far, and perhaps had not exceeded thoſe Countries which lie about the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi> 'Tis a fooliſh thing, ſays <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> in his Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>de Aetat. Mund.</hi> p. 283. to imagine, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was ſo much multiplied before the Flood, as to inhabit all the corners of the Earth. How ſlow Humane Nature was in producing Men at that time, we may eaſily gather from this, That <hi>Noah</hi> was but the ninth from <hi>Adam.</hi> Whoever computes the Matter fairly will ſee, that from thoſe eight Perſons who eſcaped the Flood, till the time of the Diſperſion of the Nations, more Men might be born, than from <hi>Adam</hi> alone in the ſpace of two thouſand years. Nevertheleſs 'tis certain, that before the Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> Mankind poſſeſſed but a ſmall part of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Therefore thoſe Perſons are very much miſtaken, who ſuppoſe, that in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time the whole World was inhabited, when perhaps only <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> were planted. Now no reaſon obliges us to extend the Inundation beyond the Bounds of the inhabited World: Nay, on the other hand 'tis abſurd to ſay, That the Effects of the Puniſhment which was inflicted upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58698:84"/>ſhould be exerted where no Men were to be found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we conſider how prodigious the heighth of the Waters muſt be, to cover all the higheſt Mountains in the World, there is not Water enough either in the Sea, or Clouds, to riſe ſo high: If there are no Mountains whoſe tops are above three Miles high, for which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>Iſaac Voſſtus</hi> in <hi>Pomp. Melam.</hi> l. 5. c. 2. and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renius</hi>'s <hi>Geogr. Gen.</hi> l. 1. c. 10. yet the Water muſt have riſen ſo high. But 'tis evident, that neither the Sea-water, nor that in Fountains and Rivers, nor Showers, were ſufficient to effect it. The Water which is contain'd within the Earth, could never be carried ſo high, unleſs the Earth ſunk in, and the Mountains were levell'd; which contradicts the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory, and though the Water of the Clouds were joyn'd to it, yet 'tis impoſſible it ſhould aſcend ſo high, ſince we ſee 'tis made up of Vapors exhaled from the Waters below; for the collected Water of the Clouds, muſt have made a much greater Maſs, than the Globe of the Earth, if it could ſo far overflow it, as to exceed the higheſt Mountains twenty Foot at leaſt, which may be proved, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the greatneſs of the watry Circles which muſt encompaſs the Earth; and the farther they are removed from the Center of it, muſt needs be ſo much the greater. Some Perſons, to clear themſelves from theſe Difficulties, in the firſt place pretend, that the Air was condens'd in its loweſt parts, and in the Caverns of the Earth,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58698:85"/>or at leaſt ſomething elſe ſerved inſtead of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And laſtly, That even the Air condenſed into Water, fell down with the Rain. But all theſe are mere Conjectures, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions not the leaſt Syllable; beſides they muſt needs confeſs, that they add Miracle to Miracle, merely to overflow thoſe Countries where there is no reaſon why a Deluge ſhould be ſent. If we ſhould ſuppoſe the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumambient Air, ſaith the above-mentioned <hi>Voſſius, in Epiſt. ad And. Col.</hi> p. 385. to be turned into Water, yet we ſhall never make the Maſs of Waters riſe one and thirty Foot and a half higher than the Superficies of the Earth. My reaſon is, Becauſe Water will never be made to riſe higher, either by Pumps, or any other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Power: For the Air that preſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and forces the Water into the Tub or Pump, makes an exact <hi>aequilibrium</hi> with the Water which is included in the Tub. Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the weight of the Water incloſed in the Tub, is the weight of that Cylinder of Air which preſſes the Water without; ſo that if the whole body of Air were condenſed, and turned into Water, yet the Superficies of the Waters would not be above thirty two Foot high. To this we may add, That to turn this Air into Water, it muſt be ſo much condenſed, that a certain quantity of it muſt equal the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water in weight. But to effect this, the Air muſt be at leaſt eight hundred times thicker than it is; for it appears by undoubted Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58698:85"/>that the exact weight of this lower Air which we breath, and which without queſtion is the heavieſt, is eight hundred times heavier at leaſt than that of Water. See <hi>Edm. Halley</hi>'s ſecond Diſſertation in the Tranſactions of the Royal Society. T. XVI. p. 104.</p>
            <p>Others that cannot digeſt this Condenſation of the Air, are of opinion that the Rain and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water was rarefied. However if we ſhould admit ſo great a Rarefaction of Water, they are <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s own words, yet to make the quantity of it no more than fifteen times greater than uſual, which is the leaſt we can ſuppoſe, it ought properly to be called a Miſt and not Water, wherein as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men nor the other Terreſtrial Creatures could have been deſtroyed, ſo the Fiſhes could not have lived in it. Beſides, had <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark been made of the lighteſt Cork imaginable, yet ſo light and thin a body could never have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhould ſtill inſiſt, that the Waters were created out of nothing, and annihilated again after all Living Creatures were deſtroyed, it may be ſaid in the firſt place, That there is nothing to countenance this Conjecture to be found in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who on the other hand expreſly tells us, That the Waters of the Abyſs and the Heavens were ſent upon the Earth: And in the next place it ought to be conſider'd, Whether 'tis ſuitable for the Divine Wiſdom to create a mighty Maſs of Waters, to overflow thoſe places where there were nothing but Beaſts, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58698:86"/>to annihilate them. Laſtly, It appears from the eighth Chapter, That the Waters were diminiſh'd by the Wind, and not by any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Effect of the Divine Omnipotence.</p>
            <p>From hence a third Argument is deduced, whereby they endeavour to prove, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge was only particular. God, ſays, <hi>Moſes,</hi> Ch. 8.1. ſent a Wind, and the Waters abated. The only thing the Wind could do was, That a few more Vapours ſhould be exhaled, or that the Water ſhould more ſwiftly be carried into ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, into which of its own accord it would not run ſoon enough; but it could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the Ocean. Who can therefore believe, that the whole Earth, cover'd with Waters to ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious a heighth, could be dried up by the Wind? 'Tis certain this could no more be effected by the Wind, than in the Beginning of all things, the Sea could be compell'd into its <hi>Alveus</hi> by it; eſpecially if we conſider, that the Sun perpetually draws up Vapours from the Earth, even without the Wind; which Vapours being in too great Plenty in the Air, fall down back again upon the Earth in Showers. Beſides, if the Wind could draw up ſo vaſt a quantity of Water in Vapours, it would follow, That there would be always much more Water in the Clouds than in the Ocean, ſince if they were all pour'd down, they could cover the whole Earth, not the higheſt Mountains excepted. But we have already ſhown that this cannot be done.</p>
            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:58698:86"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Sea-waters were ſpread all over the Face of the Earth, the Trees and ſmaller Plants could ſcarce have been preſerv'd from Deſtruction; and if all Trees in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries had been ſpoil'd by the Saltneſs of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how came they to be propagated again, ſince God is no where ſaid to have created them a-new. Now no one will be ſo Obſtinate as to deny, that in the compaſs of a year, or ſomewhat leſs, both Plants and Seeds will be corrupted in Salt-water: And thoſe that are skill'd in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy will ſcarce affirm, that they would grow again, out of putrified Mud fermented by the Sun, as was formerly believed. 'Tis true, the force of this Argument is ſomewhat abated, if the Patrons of the Univerſal Deluge anſwer as they uſe to do, that the Saltneſs of the Sea was very much taken off by ſo great a quantity of freſh Water mingled with it. However 'tis hard to imagine, how ſeveral Plants could continue ſo long a ſpace even under freſh Water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being kill'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If all the Animals of all Countries in the World came to <hi>Noah</hi> in general, as 'tis plain they muſt needs come, ſuppoſe both Hemiſpheres were covered with Water, It may be enquired into, how ſo many Animals, which are peculiar to <hi>America,</hi> could come from that Continent to <hi>Meſopotamia?</hi> If <hi>America</hi> is any where joyn'd to our part of the World, it muſt be far North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards under a cold Climate, which Beaſts, that are proper to the Torrid <hi>Zone,</hi> cannot endure.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58698:87"/>Nay, if we ſuppoſe it to be joyn'd to our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate under a more favourable Latitude, how could the <hi>American</hi> Beaſts, but the Serpents more eſpecially, poſſibly get over ſo many Rivers, and Lakes, and Mountains, and find their way through ſo many Woods in ſo long a Journey? By what means, ſays <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> p. 398. could that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, for inſtance, which from the ſlowneſs of its Motion, is called the <hi>Lazy,</hi> arrive to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, and travel ſo many Miles, which after its own natural Pace, it could not perform in the ſpace of Twenty thouſand years.</p>
            <p>Let the Patrons of an Univerſal Deluge like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inform us, after what manner (<hi>Id.</hi> p. 186.) theſe Animals, leaving <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark and the ancient World, found their way into <hi>America,</hi> and Lands that are disjoyned by a vaſt Ocean. Another Abſurdity too would follow, which is this, that ſuch innumerable ſorts of Creatures, which were unknown to our World both formerly and now, ſhould paſs through ſuch mighty Tracts of Ground, and not leave any remainders of their ſeveral Kinds in their former Habitations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The very building of the Ark pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with no leſs Difficulties, if it were true, what the generality of Mankind believes, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was a common Receptacle of all Beaſts, and that we cannot name one Animal, whoſe Poſterity did not come out of this Manſion. If we only compute thoſe Creatures which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found in the old World, yet the room which the Scriptures allow for this Ark, could
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58698:87"/>not contain ſo many different Species, and the Food that was neceſſary to maintain them ſo long. But if we take in the Beaſts of the New World, and the Southern Hemiſphere, there will not be room enough for the Animals themſelves, much leſs for the vaſt Proviſions to keep them alive there. Beſides, a Man cannot eaſily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how theſe Animals, after what manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were diſtributed into their Cells, and their ſeveral Apartments kept clean, could live ſo long in this cloſe Confinement. The Queſtion too may be put, whether they generated in the Ark, which, if any one denies, 'tis very ſtrange, that theſe Brutes, which if you except a few of them, are hot for Copulation once a year at leaſt, ſhould abſtain from it; and if 'tis affirm'd then, as their Off-ſpring increaſed, there muſt be of courſe a greater Conſumption of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. Several Perſons here have recourſe to Miracles, which as they might happen, ſo we need not ſuppoſe them without urgent neceſſity. But what neceſſity is there, that Countries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Men, and the Animals of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſhould be overflown?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> To leſſen this Difficulty, perhaps it may be objected, That no more Creatures were created in every Species than in that of Man. But the above-mention'd Learned Man thus confutes them. God, ſays he, from the Creation, fill'd the whole World, according to the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Faculty of every Country and Sea, with all ſorts of Beaſts, Fiſhes and Trees. But Man
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58698:88"/>alone is ſaid to be created by himſelf. Now it would be monſtrouſly abſurd to imagine, That only two Animals of every Species, and that only in one place, were formed by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. For if we are of that Opinion, what will become of thoſe Plants and Animals which only breed in peculiar Continents, and which, for the above-mention'd reaſon, could not be transferr'd, and propagated from our World to theirs?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Theſe are the Arguments which have been urged to prove, That only the inhabited part of the Earth, and its Animals, ſuffer'd in the Deluge. But becauſe the Maintainers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion object. That when God ſpeaks, all Humane Reaſoning ought to ceaſe: True it is, ſay the Patrons of a Particular Flood, and ſo it ought, if the Divine Words would only admit of an Interpretation. And thus the moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in the third Book and fourth Chapter of his <hi>Origines Sacrae,</hi> where he treats of this Subject with that Learning and Judgment which is ſo peculiar to him, owns, that it cannot be proved by any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Arguments drawn from the Scriptures, that the whole Superficies of the Earth was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd. We are at leiſure now to examine the Anſwers they bring to the above-cited Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though <hi>All</hi> Creatures are ſaid to be admitted into the Ark, yet they obſerve that the word <hi>All</hi> is of doubtful Signification, and is very ſeldom taken abſolutely, but in moſt places is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the Subject then in hand. Even in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58698:88"/>the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, where he tell us, That a Famine prevail'd <hi>in All the Earth;</hi> our Divines own, that 'tis to be underſtood only of a particular part of the World. Thus <hi>Voſſius,</hi> nay, other Writers, when they ſpeak of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of Animals, expreſs themſelves after the ſame manner. <hi>Livy,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Circenſian</hi> Spectacles as they were exhibited in his Age, has the following words, Lib. 44. c. 9. It was the Faſhion then, even before our Modern Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was introduced, of filling the <hi>Circus</hi> with the Beaſts of <hi>ALL NATIONS,</hi> to divert the People with ſeveral ſorts of Spectacles. Here a few Nations, that were either Neighbours, or Subjects of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, are called <hi>Omnes Gentes.</hi> In like manner ſeveral Birds and Beaſts in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ch. 31.6. where the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> is deſcribed under the Repreſentation of a Tree, are called <hi>All.</hi> In the Leaves of it <hi>All</hi> the Birds of the Air built their Neſts, under its Boughs <hi>All</hi> the Beaſts of the Field did Copulate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Shade did dwell <hi>All</hi> Nations. See <hi>Daniel</hi> 4.18. ſo likewiſe <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.3. where the great Devaſtation of <hi>Judaea</hi> is deſcribed: Therefore, ſays the Prophet, the Earth ſhall Mourn, and <hi>All</hi> dwelling therein, among the Beaſts of the Field, and the Birds of the Air, they ſhall fall Sick, yea, the Fiſhes of the Sea ſhall be deſtroy'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>All</hi> Animals, Clean and Unclean, that were let into the Ark, are to be underſtood only of thoſe which that Country produc'd, where the firſt Seat of Mankind was, <hi>viz.</hi> That Fruitful
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58698:89"/>Territory about the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates:</hi> And perhaps the <hi>All</hi> here does not comprehend thoſe of <hi>All</hi> Kinds, but only <hi>All</hi> thoſe which are uſeful to Man. Of which Nature are the Cattel they feed upon, as Oxen, Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Horſes, Aſſes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, which were there imploy'd in carrying of Burdens, but therefore call'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> becauſe they were not uſed for Food. Of Birds there might be Cocks, Geeſe, Ducks, Pigeons, Ravens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor is it ſtrange that <hi>Noah</hi> was commanded to preſerve theſe Animals, which could not be had out of the neighbouring Countries, nor tamed without a long and tedious Trouble.</p>
            <p>As for what relates to <hi>Noah,</hi> the Reaſons why he was not ordered to fly to the adjoyning Country where the Deluge did not reach, were, becauſe other People ſhould not follow him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Beſides, it was convenient, that the Ark wherein he was to be preſerved from the Deluge, ſhould be built before thoſe very Perſons to whom he foretold it, that ſo they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd he ſpoke to them in earneſt. God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> conjectures, thought that his Juſtice was not to be exerted but in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place. Now what more convenient place can be imagin'd than this, where the Guilty were to be puniſh'd in <hi>Noah</hi>'s ſight, and he that was Innocent, ſhould be ſaved in the midſt of Sinners?</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Where it is ſaid, That <hi>all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> were deſtroy'd, the place muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only of thoſe Animals that were within the Limits of the overflow'd Countries: Which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58698:89"/>is not only the anſwer of <hi>Voſſius,</hi> but of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> Nay, from what has already been ſaid, concerning the word <hi>All,</hi> we may gather, That 'tis not inconſiſtent with the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Narration, to ſuppoſe, that not all, but many Animals, and eſpecially ſuch as were in a more particular manner ſerviceable to Mankind, were deſtroy'd.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Noah</hi> tarried in the Ark till the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were dried up, becauſe it would be more convenient for him to ſet footing in a Country which he was formerly acquainted with, and which was free from Wild Beaſts, than in an unknown place, full of Savage Creatures. No doubt on't, but the Soil was ſufficiently damag'd by the Stagnation of the Water; but <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and the adjoyning Countries, being watered by vaſt noble Rivers, received leſs Detriment from the Salt Water, than others that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of freſh Streams; ſo that 'tis reaſonable to believe, they recover'd their former Fertility in a ſhort ſpace.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The higheſt Mountains that were covered to ſo vaſt a heighth by the Flood, were thoſe which were ſcituate in theſe Countries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which Mankind was not at that time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated. Nor does that Addition, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> oblige us to believe the contrary, ſince it is ſometimes uſed of a few neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.25. On that day will I begin to ſend the Fear and Terror of thee, through the People under all the Heavens, <hi>Sub omni Coelo.</hi>

            </list>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:58698:90"/>
            <p>Having thus conſider'd what might be ſaid in behalf of this Opinion againſt the former, it now remains to be enquir'd how far, according to this Hypotheſis, the Deluge might extend. But ſince we do not know what Countries were then inhabited, What Man dares preſume to define the Bounds of the Flood? Perhaps that Tract of Ground which lies between the four Seas, the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> the <hi>Euxine,</hi> and the <hi>Syrian;</hi> in which compaſs we find the <hi>Tigris,</hi> the <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and ſeveral other vaſt Rivers, were by the Eruption of all Waters, and by the Clouds, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from all parts of the World by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, and there condens'd into Moiſture, buried and overflow'd. 'Tis true, this could not be effected without a Miracle; but then there is no way to ſolve the Difficulties of ſo great a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taclyſm</hi> without a Miracle. However the leſs and fewer of this Kind we ſuppoſe, provided the reſt may be conveniently explain'd, that Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition uſes to be accounted the moſt agreeable to Truth by all Interpreters, becauſe God is never ſo prodigal of Miracles, as to have recourſe to them where Natural Cauſes are ſufficient; much leſs does he violate and overturn all the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Laws of Nature without good reaſon. In this very Hiſtory we find, that God was pleaſed to give <hi>Noah</hi> notice when it was time for him to go into the Ark, becauſe he could ſcarce know it of himſelf, but he does not tell him the time when he was to go out of it, but left the Matter wholly to his own Diſcretion,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58698:90"/>becauſe he might very well know it without the Divine Aſſiſtance. He might, if it had ſo pleaſed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, have preſerved all the Animals in the Ark alive without any Aliment, which had made the Ark conſiderably lighter, and had ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> a great deal of trouble; and yet we ſee he did not do it, becauſe theſe Creatures might be ſupplied with Food by Humane Diligence. Where the Induſtry of Man ceaſes, there the Divine Help begins; and <hi>Vice versâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Favourers of a Particular Deluge ſupport their Opinion, but it has been objected againſt them, That if this Suppoſition were true, the Superficies of the Water could not have been perfectly Spherical, and conſequently that the Ark in this great Declivity, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily incline to the lower places. But as <hi>Voſſius</hi> has very well anſwered, that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in leſſer Inundations, the ſame might fall out in this great, and more than Natural Deluge. For the ſame Power which drove the Seas and Clouds to that Tract of Earth which was to be deſtroy'd, did likewiſe ſuſtain the Ark, and the Declivity of the Water, as long as there was occaſion for it.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">I. BEFORE this wonderful Confuſion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Babel,</hi> the Sacred Hiſtorian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly tells us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.1. That <hi>the whole Earth was of one Lip, and of the ſame words;</hi> or as we have tranſlated it, <hi>of one Language, and of one Speech;</hi> becauſe 'tis evident that the word <hi>Lip,</hi> both here and in ſeveral other places, ſignifies <hi>Speech;</hi> and the reaſon of it is, Becauſe the Lips are no leſs ſerviceable to us in ſpeaking, than the Tongue it ſelf, ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 19.18. No one doubts, but that one Univerſal Language was ſpoken by all Mankind at this time; but whether <hi>Moſes</hi> has here a regard to that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is not ſo plain. Perhaps theſe words may ſignifie, that Men lived
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58698:91"/>in a State of Peace and Concord, becauſe 'tis equally neceſſary towards the Building of any City, that Men ſhould agree in their Sentiments and Inclinations, as well as in their Language: Nor does the Idiom of the Hebrew Language reject this Interpretation. Thus for inſtance to denote the unanimous Agreement of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> to beat back the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by main force, <hi>They gathered themſelves together</hi> (ſays the Sacred Hiſtory <hi>Joſhua</hi> 9.2.) <hi>to fight with</hi> Joſhua, <hi>and with</hi> Iſrael <hi>with one mouth.</hi> Thus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Falſe Prophets agreeing together in their Predictions, <hi>declared good unto the King with one mouth,</hi> 1 Kings 22.13. Hence it is, that <hi>to ſpeak with the Lip of another,</hi> is the ſame thing as to agree, as appears by the above-cited place of <hi>Iſaiah, In that day ſhall five Cities in the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>ſpeak the lip of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and Swear to the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> that is to ſay, They ſhall be of the ſame Opinion with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that inhabit the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And indeed the words <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Labium,</hi> &amp; <hi>una Verba,</hi> ſeem rather to ſignifie Agreement <hi>of Mind than of Language,</hi> although 'tis certain there was but one Language then in the World. For by <hi>cadem</hi> or <hi>una verba</hi> we are not here to underſtand the ſame Sounds, and the ſame Syllables, but <hi>voces conſentientes</hi> Unity of Mind. <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it <hi>the ſame</hi> deſign.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Learned Men have rightly enough ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that in Scripture <hi>to make ones ſelf a Name,</hi> is all one as to <hi>get ones ſelf a Fame</hi> or <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:58698:92"/>in which ſence this Expreſſion is to be found, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63.12. <hi>Jer</hi> 32.20. &amp; <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.15. and ſo this Tower might be ſaid to be built <hi>in nomen, i. e.</hi> to ſpread the Fame of the Builders all over the World, which Phraſe is to be met with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.5. where mention is made of the Building of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But this cannot poſſibly be the meaning of this place, for what an odd ſort of a Concluſion would this be; Let us acquire our ſelves a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt we be diſperſed all over the Earth? Beſides with whom would all Mankind which was concerned in the Building of this City, have gotten Glory and Fame? With their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as ſome will be apt to ſay, but then what fine Sence would this make, Let us make our ſelves Famous with Poſterity, leſt we be ſcattered into ſeveral Countries? If we carefully examine theſe words, and revolve the whole Hiſtory in our Mind, we ſhall find the meaning of the place to be to this or the like purpoſe. Let us build us a City that may be the Metropolis of all the World, in which let there be one Government, the Seat of which Empire ſhall be perpetually in that City, leſt Mankind be ſcattered all over the World, according to the Fancy of every rambling Family. If this Interpretation be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it will follow, that <hi>to make us a Name,</hi> at leaſt in this place, ſignifies in a manner the ſame as <hi>to leave our name ſomewhere,</hi> i. e. to make a place Famous with our Habitation, ſo that it derives its name from the Inhabitant, ſee
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58698:92"/>1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.3. &amp; 14.21. Perhaps a <hi>Name</hi> here denotes a Monument which is called by the Name of the Perſon that erected it. Thus <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> in his Life time had reared up for himſelf a Pillar, which is in the King's Dale, for he ſaid, I have no Son to keep my Name in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and he called the Pillar after his own Name, and it is called unto this day <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s place, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.18. So <hi>Cain</hi> not long after the Creation of the World built a City, which he called after the Name of his Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.17. In like manner Men were now reſolved to build a City, which perhaps they would have called <gap reason="foreign">

Thus upon the building of this Metropolis, there would have been but one Empire in the World, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was deſign'd at firſt with no ill Intention, but becauſe this Project drew ſeveral great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences along with it, as we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after obſerve, God was pleaſed to blaſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint it.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Let us go down.</hi> The Interpreters are divided about the meaning of this paſſage, as well as that of <hi>Let us make Man</hi> in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Some both Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are of opinion, that God is here intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſpeaking <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> after the manner of Kings, who as they act not only by their own Judgment, but that of their Privy-Counſellors, uſe the plural number when they ſpeak to their People. Nay ſometimes they ſpeak after this faſhion, when they conſult their Nobles. Thus 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.9. <hi>What Counſel give you that we may anſwer this People?</hi> ſays <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to his young Adviſers. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Eſdras</hi> 4.18. Thus God himſelf alſo is deſcribed like a King conſulting his Noble-men, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Who ſhall perſwade</hi> Ahab <hi>that he may go up, and fall at</hi> Ramoth-Gilead? <hi>And one ſaid on this manner, and another ſaid on that manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others pretend there is no neceſſity to have recourſe to this Cuſtom of Kings, ſince ſometimes we find in the Hebrew, as well as in the Greek and Latin Languages, particular Men ſpeaking of themſelves in the plural Number. Thus <hi>Bildad</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:58698:94"/>ſpeaks to <hi>Job,</hi> when only they two were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Quando tandem finem imponetis ſermonibus? Intelligite &amp; poſtea loquemur. Cur reputamur ut Jumentum, &amp; ſorduimus in oculis veſtris?</hi> Job 18.2, 3. ſee likewiſe <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.20. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.36.</p>
            <p>Some of the later <hi>Rabbins,</hi> as well as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Jews</hi> maintain, that God ſpeaks to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels here as to his Guards. The <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Wiſe Men indeed never deſcribe God doing any thing but without a great attendance of Angels, as <hi>Jamblichus</hi> often informs us, and particularly § 5. c. 21. that all thoſe Powers that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them, go before the Preſence of the Gods, and whenever they make a Proceſſion to the Earth, bear them company. And the Jewiſh Maſters, who, as ſome Learned Men imagine, borrow'd their Doctrine concerning Angels out of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> were of the ſame Opinion. <hi>Origen</hi> in his Homily upon <hi>Numbers</hi> 11. is of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and St. <hi>Auſtin de Civ. Dei,</hi> lib. 16. cap. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Some Chriſtians believe that the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis of the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are here ſpoken to by the Hypoſtaſis of the Father. 'Tis indeed certain that ſeveral Chriſtians, even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the times of the Apoſtles, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that in that famous paſſage of <hi>Geneſis, Let us make Man,</hi> God the Father ſpoke to the Son. Thus <hi>Barnabas</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, according to the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, but in the fifth of that of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Our Lord, ſays he, vouchſafed to ſuffer for our Salvation, though he is Lord of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58698:94"/>the Univerſe, to whom his Father ſaid before the Creation of the World, <hi>Let us make Man. Hug. Menard</hi> upon this place of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> has proved that ſome of the later Fathers after him, as <hi>Juſtin, Irenaeus, Theophilus,</hi> and ſeveral more, were of the ſame opinion. But after all, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men of the greateſt Reputation in the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World, think that neither of theſe two Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are to be urged too poſitively againſt the Jews, as if they amounted to the force of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Hebrew Root <hi>balal,</hi> which we have Engliſhed to <hi>confound,</hi> properly ſignifies <hi>to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle things of a different nature;</hi> but what it means in this place, is not agreed among the Annotators. Some are of opinion that God ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extirpated the Memory of the Primitive Language out of the Minds of Men, and ſent a new one to each Clan or Family: Others main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this happen'd neither to <hi>Heber</hi> nor any of his Progeny, who ſtill kept up the uſe of the Primitive Language, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hebrew: And laſtly, others pretend that only the Memories of Men were diſturbed, ſo that they fell upon new Dialects of the firſt Tongue, but invented no new ones wholly different from the firſt; and theſe ſupport their Hypotheſis by the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <hi>Balal,</hi> which ſignifies to mingle and not to create. However, moſt of them are agreed that it happen'd in an inſtant, by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Miracle. For my part, I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould believe this Confuſion was wrought
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58698:95"/>in a moment: Though this Hiſtory indeed is related in the compaſs of a few lines, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that followed upon God's Determination, is immediately ſubjoined, yet no rational Man will from thence conclude that it was all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted on the ſudden. Don't we find that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> delivers the Original of Mankind in a ſhort <hi>Compendium,</hi> and that the Occurrences of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages are related in a few lines. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis more credible that a Spirit of Diſcord was ſent among Men, upon which they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd this fooliſh Undertaking, and diſperſing into the neighbouring Countries, and removing their Habitations from one place to another, as they happen'd to be ſtraitned for want of room, till in proceſs of time living at a great diſtance from one another, and maintaining little or no Correſpondence, their Languages came to be changed. Now becauſe theſe Paſſages are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſacred Hiſtorian in a compendious Narration, the Interpreters erroneouſly believed that they were done in as ſhort a time, as the Verſes in which they are ſet down, may be read.</p>
            <p>As we have already ſhown, that thoſe Perſons may be ſaid to ſpeak one Tongue who live ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably and like Friends together; ſo the Jews ſay of thoſe that are at variance, that their Tongues are not only confuſed, but divided. Thus <hi>David</hi> in the 55th Pſalm v. 10. when his Enemies concerted together how to deſtroy him, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>divide their Tongues;</hi> that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58698:95"/>is, make Diſcord and Diſſention ariſe among them that they may no longer unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to act againſt me, and contrive my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. As we have already obſerved, theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who attempted to build a Metropolis for all Mankind, may rather be charged with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence or Folly, than any Impiety. Let us now ſee whether we may be able to conjecture for what reaſon God diſliked and fruſtrated their Undertaking.
<list>
                  <item>1. Two celebrated Rabbis, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben Ezra</hi> and <hi>Levi ben Gerſom,</hi> who deny that the Builders of <hi>Babel</hi> were guilty of any Sin, becauſe they deſign'd nothing more by this Project than to perpetuate the Society of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and hinder them from diſperſing, are of Opinion, that therefore God was pleaſed to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their Attempt, leaſt if they all lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of one Country, all Mankind might at once be deſtroy'd by an Earthquake, Conflagration, Hail, Deluge, or any Accidents of the like nature.</item>
                  <item>2. Since Empires are at firſt poſſeſs'd by thoſe that are not the beſt of Men, but ſuch as either by Fraud or Strength aſpire to a Soveraignty above their Fellows, all Mankind wou'd have been ſubject to the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Will of one Tyrant, as <hi>Nimrod</hi> is not long after ſaid to have been, which might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the occaſion of innumerable Calamities. For when there are ſeveral Republicks, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kingdoms, if the Inhabitants of one place happen to be oppreſs'd by Tyrannic Power,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58698:96"/>thoſe that are able to endure the Yoke no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, may fly into other Countries; which if there was only one Governour of the Univerſe they could never do, becauſe they cou'd not go to deſolate uninhabited places without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger: Therefore all Men would be obnoxious to the Cruelty of one wicked Tyrant, if there was no more than one Monarchy in the World.</item>
                  <item>3. If the profligate Lives and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities of the ſupream Governors are copied by the common People, as we find it true by a thouſand Examples, then the Vices of ill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had in a ſhort time been the Vices of all Mankind. On the other ſide, when ſeveral Kingdoms are on foot at the ſame time, if the Infection of Vice prevails in one place, Vertue and Good Manners flouriſh in another. If the truth of this Aſſertion wanted to be confirmed from Citations drawn out of Hiſtory, we cou'd eaſily convince the Reader, that both under the Perſian Empire which poſſeſſed a great part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and under the Macedonian which ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it; and laſtly, under the Roman Monarchy when it was in its greateſt extent, there was more Wickedneſs of all ſorts committed, and the Manners of Men were generally more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched and irregular, than when theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Countries ſet up ſeveral Republicks and Kingdoms of their own.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Joſephus, Ant. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. who thinks that God would have them diſperſed into ſeveral Colonies for the greater Increaſe and Propagation of Mankind,

IT hath been a Queſtion long debated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Learned Men, Whether the Jews borrowed this Ceremony from the Aegyptians, ſince it appears by the undoubted Teſtimonies of the Ancients that other Nations, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the latter, uſed Circumciſion; or on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, Whether the Aegyptians had it from

Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Teſtimony is ſo plain againſt them, yet ſeveral Perſons maintain that Circumciſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and particularly from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> whom God commanded to obſerve it, as is evident from the 17th Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as a peculiar ſign to diſtinguiſh his Poſterity from other Nations. The Learned <hi>Spencer, de Legibus Moſ. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. cites the Reaſons urged on both ſides at large, and compares them whom the Reader may conſult for his farther Satisfaction. 'Tis indeed not improbable to ſuppoſe, that though this Cuſtom had been long before obſerv'd by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> either for the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58698:97"/>ſake of Cleanlineſs, which they principally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or for ſome other reaſon we are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; yet God for another End might enjoin <hi>Abraham</hi> to obſerve it. And thus nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Jews</hi> derived it from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> nor the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> although the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Cuſtom gave the occaſion to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Precept. It ſeems incredible to many, that ſo inconvenient and troubleſom a Ceremony, and when performed upon Perſons that were arrived to years of Maturity, ſo indecent; and laſtly, which does not in the leaſt contribute to Piety, and Good Manners, ſhould be at firſt inſtituted by God Almighty. They therefore ſuſpect that <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had ſeen it done in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and perhaps was inform'd by ſome <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Servants, whom he had carried with him from <hi>Aegypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> of the Reaſons they alledged for a Rite which ſeems otherwiſe ſo abſurd, to have mightily approv'd of it: which, when God Almighty perceiv'd, who by a wonderful Condeſcenſion accommodates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to humane Imbecillity, commanded <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to obſerve that Cuſtom, which he liked in other Nations. And yet it is not to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from hence, that the Circumciſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> is the ſame, becauſe, not to mention that it was not done at the ſame time, and perhaps the Rites too were different, the cauſe in both was not the ſame. <hi>Origen,</hi> in his Learned Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> has a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Paſſage upon this occaſion. <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 263.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58698:98"/>of the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Edition. <hi>The reaſon of the Jewiſh Circumciſion was not the ſame with that of the Aegyptians or Colchians, and therefore we muſt not ſuppoſe the Circumciſion was the ſame. As for inſtance, a Prieſt that offers Sacrifice, does not offer it to the ſame Divinity, though he ſeems to perform thoſe ſacred Rites after the ſame manner; and as he that prays does not ſay the ſame Prayer with another, although he ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for the ſame things; ſo likewiſe though one be circumciſed, we muſt not infer that there is no real difference between his Circumciſion, and that of other People. For the Intention, the Law, and Will of him that circumciſes, makes it a different matter.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. The ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were uſed to aſſign four Reaſons why this Covenant was rather inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Prepuce, than any other part of the Body. The firſt is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>the Prevention of a troubleſom Diſeaſe, and hard to be cured, which they call a Carbuncle, becauſe it is apt to be inflamed.</hi> Theſe are the expreſs words of <hi>Philo,</hi> in his Treatiſe concerning Circumciſion, who was of Opinion, That thoſe that were uncircumciſed, were more obnoxious to this Diſtemper than the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Cornelius Celſus, l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 18. §. 5. teaches us a way how to cure this Diſeaſe; but I very much queſtion whether it viſits the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, more than the Circumciſed, provided they live chaſtly.</p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:58698:98"/>
            <p>The other is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>the Purity of the whole Body, which becomes thoſe of the ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Function:</hi> For which reaſon the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts ſhaved their Bodies, becauſe ſomething ſtuck to the Hair and Body, which was to be cleanſed. But too great an Affectation of Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is troubleſom and ſuperſtitious, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Care, eſpecially in a hot Climate, is both wholeſom and commendable.</p>
            <p>The third is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>the reſemblance of the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed part with the Heart:</hi> So that the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this part was as it were a Symbol of the Circumciſion of the Heart; that is to ſay, of a Mind purged from all unlawful Affections; which is the reaſon that the <hi>Jews</hi> are frequently upbraided with an <hi>uncircumciſed Heart.</hi> See <hi>Leviticus</hi> 26.41. But <hi>Philo,</hi> and ſome others, believed, that the renouncing of all diſhoneſt Pleaſures was chiefly ſignified by it: <hi>Becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the great variety of Pleaſures, that of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Copulation is ſaid to exceed the reſt; our Lawgivers thought fit to circumciſe the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Coition, obſcurely intimating hereby, a Circumciſion of all ſuperfluous and immoderate Pleaſure, and not of one alone; but this being the greateſt, and that to which Mankind expreſſes the fierceſt Inclination, comprehends all the reſt.</hi> And this indeed is agreeable to the Cuſtom of the Eaſtern Nations, who inſtructed their Diſciples, not only by words, but things in order to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58698:99"/>make the greater Impreſſion upon their Minds.</p>
            <p>The fourth, and the moſt neceſſary of all, as <hi>Philo</hi> tells us, was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>a Preparative to beget a numerous Iſſue; for,</hi> if we may believe him, <hi>thoſe Nations which uſe Circumciſion, are infinitely more populous than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> But, with Submiſſion be it ſpoken, this Reaſon ſeems to be none of the trueſt, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Example of the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> But perhaps <hi>Philo</hi> was of this Opinion, becauſe he ſaw his Country-men the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> begot abundance of Children, which is not however to be aſcribed to their Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but to the Diſpoſition of their Climate and Soil; or as ſome would have it, to the Water of <hi>Nile. Rabbi Levi Barcinonenſis,</hi> who has plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and briefly expounded the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Precepts, after he has told us of I know not what Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Body and Soul, which, as he pretends, is either ſignified, or conferr'd by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, adds this as his laſt and ſtrongeſt Reaſon, that <hi>God</hi> for ever bleſſed hereby diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes his Select People from others, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Mark on their Bodies. And purſuant to this 'tis worthy of Obſervation, that in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> Men were anointed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or walked in the Sun, or uſed Athletical Exerciſes, or waſhed themſelves in Company with others; whereby 'twas an impoſſible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conceal Circumciſion: for which reaſon thoſe Perſons that had no mind to paſs for <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:58698:99"/>got a Trick of drawing forward the Prepuce, as you may find in <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the 1ſt Epiſtle of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Ch. 7. v. 18. The ſame Artifice was uſed by thoſe under the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> who thought fit to live within the City, and yet wou'd not pay the Tributes that were impoſed upon thoſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation; for they ſo well diſſembled the matter, that when they were ſearched they cou'd not be diſcovered. <hi>I remember,</hi> ſays <hi>Suetonius,</hi> in his Life of <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> ch. 12. <hi>I was preſent when an old Fellow, ninety years of Age, was examin'd by the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator and a large Aſſembly, whether he was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. As for the time of its Celebration, it was preciſely obſerv'd on the eighth Day after the Birth of the Child; which is to be underſtood of their Children or Servants that were born at home, for they could not circumciſe the reſt, before they had them. Nothing but Sickneſs, as the Rabbies inform us, cou'd excuſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of it beyond this time; and indeed, ſince this Ceremony was perform'd upon an Infant with much more Eaſe and Decency, than it cou'd be upon thoſe of a riper Age, it ſeems a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to believe, that a poſitive time was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, leaſt by degrees it ſhould be deferr'd too far, and at laſt wholly laid aſide. But beſides the expreſs Words of the Law, the <hi>Jews</hi> might be the more inclin'd to obſerve the Execution of it upon the eighth Day, becauſe, as we find in <hi>Origen, contra Celſ. l.</hi> 5. the <hi>Colchians,</hi> the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:58698:100"/>and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> uſed it later; by which Circumſtance they ſuppoſed their Circumciſion to be diſtinguiſhed from all others. The volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Neglect of it, according to ſome Chriſtian Interpreters, was puniſhed by Death, according to others by Excommunication; however, this is certain, that an uncircumciſed <hi>Hebrew,</hi> if he were publickly known to be ſuch, forfeited all the Rights and Privileges of a Member of that Republick; and if he was not actually baniſhed, was reckon'd to be no better than a Heathen. 'Tis probable, that the Author of theſe Verſes, which are to be found among the Fragments of <hi>Petronius,</hi> meant this, which without doubt he had heard from ſome <hi>Jews</hi> of his Age.</p>

            <p>The Pagans erroneouſly believ'd, that a Hog was worſhipt by the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd from eating of that Creature; the other Calumny of their adoring an Aſs's Head, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed groſſer; but after this manner either <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius,</hi> or ſome one elſe, deſcribes the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. However, he tells us, that the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe Deities was not ſufficient for the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58698:100"/>
               <hi>Jews;</hi> but that unleſs he was likewiſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, he was not eſteem'd a <hi>Jew,</hi> but reckon'd as a <hi>Greek;</hi> who being deſcended from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> preſum'd to worſhip the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> uncircumciſed.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. What has been ſaid of Circumciſion, may be affirm'd of ſeveral other Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in uſe with the <hi>Hebrews, viz.</hi> that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laudable or innocent Inſtitutions their Neighbours the Heathens had, the Patriarchs might confirm with their Example. Now, as when we go to handle any thing of value which we mightily eſteem, or when we are to appear upon any ſolemn occaſion, we waſh our Hands, leaſt any Filth or Dirt ſhould ſtick to them, and put on our cleaneſt Apparel: So thoſe, that were going upon the Exerciſe of Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thought it a heinous Sin to approach the Altar with unwaſhed Hands, and dirty Linen; not that Naſtineſs was of it ſelf hated by God Almighty, but becauſe it ſeem'd to intimate a Neglect of the Buſineſs then in doing, and might give thoſe Perſons, who judge of things by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Appearances, a Contempt and Diſreliſh for ſacred things. And as the Patriarchs were not unacquainted with this Reaſon, can any one think it ſtrange that it was approved by them? If any one pretends to maintain, that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs were the Inventors of this, and the like Rites; in the firſt place 'tis certain he is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Authority of the Scripture, which no where affirms ſo much: and ſecondly, it will
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58698:101"/>be a difficult matter to prove, that the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Nations in the World borrowed theſe Rites from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who were a deſpicable and unknown People, and neither for Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or Antiquity to be compar'd with the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians.</hi> Thus for inſtance, we read, <hi>Gen. c.</hi> 28.18. that <hi>Jacob</hi> erected a Stone, and poured Oyl upon the top of it. 'Tis evident from ſeveral Authors that the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Syrians,</hi> uſed to conſecrate rude, unwrought Stones, and anointed them with Oyl, and ſeveral believe that they imitated <hi>Jacob</hi> in this particular, and that from them this Cuſtom was propagated to other Nations. But certainly 'tis much more probable, that <hi>Jacob</hi> follow'd a Cuſtom uſed long before his time, and that one Man imitated thoſe populous Nations, where he lived, than that theſe Nations ſhould tread after the Footſteps of a Perſon who was in a manner unknown to them, and differ'd from them in his Sentiments of Religion. Before God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty had revealed to <hi>Moſes</hi> after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he would be worſhipped, and what ſacred Rites he would have obſerv'd, pious Men were left to their own liberty, to follow what Rites they pleaſed, provided the Religion of the Mind, which is the only true Religion, was not viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them: for as Words depend from uſe, which alone ſtamps a peculiar Force and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, ſo the Signification of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal indifferent Ceremonies is juſt ſuch, as the Perſon that uſes them, does make them.</p>

               <hi>Diſſertation VIII.</hi> Concerning the Divine Appearances in the Old Teſtament.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> no where gives us a full account of them. <hi>II.</hi> Of thoſe that happen'd by night, or when they were aſleep, <hi>III.</hi> Of thoſe that were ſeen in the day-time. <hi>IV.</hi> By what Means they were able to diſtinguiſh them from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Impoſtures. <hi>V.</hi> How they knew God from a Good Angel; and laſtly, a Good Angel from an Evil Spirit.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">I. THough <hi>Moſes</hi> makes frequent mention of the Divine Appearances, yet he no where gives us ſo full a Deſcription of them as to let us know by what particular Tokens, the Ancients, to whom God vouchſafed to reveal himſelf, were able to diſcover him. Therefore we have nothing more left us to do, but out of the ſeveral Hiſtories we find ſcatter'd up and down the ſacred Writers, to gather as many Circumſtances of this matter as we can. Briefly, then, both God and Angels are ſaid to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by night and by day, in Dreams, and in waking to <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſeveral more beſide him.</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:58698:102"/>
            <p n="2">II. By night he ſaid thoſe things to <hi>Abraham</hi> which we read of Chapter the fifteenth, where God is ſaid to have ſpoken to him <hi>in a Viſion;</hi> which ſeems to be the ſame, as <hi>in the Viſions of the night,</hi> Ch. 46. v. 2. In the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the 15th Chapter, <hi>Abraham,</hi> being faſt aſleep, hears the Voice of God calling out to him. <hi>Jacob</hi> likewiſe ſees, and hears God in his ſleep, ch. 27.12, 13. and elſewhere. Nay, God warns <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> ch. 20.20. and <hi>Laban,</hi> ch. 31.24. when they were aſleep. Now it appears from the above-mentioned places, that they heard a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Voice in their Sleep; but it is not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, from whence the Sound of the Words ſeemed to proceed; neither does <hi>Moſes</hi> inform us what ſort of Ideas, or Images, affected their Minds, when they underſtood that God ſpoke to them. Perhaps no Impreſſion was made upon them, but only a Voice heard, as it is evident by the Hiſtory of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. who heard a Voice which awaked him. Others in their Sleep thought they heard a Voice, and made anſwer again, as <hi>Abimelech,</hi> ch. 20. and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ch. 15. <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo ſaw a certain Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of God ſitting upon a Ladder, which ſeem'd to ſpeak, <hi>ch.</hi> 27.19. But <hi>Moſes</hi> does not ſubjoin what it was; however, it appears to have been the ſame which was ſeen by thoſe that were awake, of which we ſhall diſcourſe anon.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhall here enquire, how they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed Divine Dreams from thoſe that were
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58698:102"/>purely natural? 'Tis eaſier to acquaint him with what others have conjectur'd, than to give any poſitive Determination of the matter. But the Miſchief is, that what they tell us upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is not drawn from their own Experience, nor from the Relation of thoſe who have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tried theſe things, but from certain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Conjectures, as we may ſee in <hi>Jamblichus de Myſter. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. and <hi>Seqq.</hi> and <hi>J. Smith,</hi> who in his <hi>Diſſertation of Prophecy,</hi> ch. 3. and 4. has gathered all the Opinions of the Ancients a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this difficult Point. If we were obliged, out of the ſeveral Conjectures, to chooſe that which pleaſes us moſt, we ſhould believe that thoſe ſpeak moſt judiciouſly to the buſineſs in hand, who affirm, that Divine Dreams are no otherwiſe to be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, than that,
<list>
                  <item>1. They have none of thoſe confuſed and idle Phantaſms that delude us in other Dreams, but diſtinctly repreſented to our Minds whatever Things or Being God was pleaſed to ſend, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of foreign Images or Words; ſo that every thing was very plainly ſeen, or heard.</item>
                  <item>2. That they are more lively than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dreams, and make a more forcible Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Mind, ſo that they were deeply ſixt in the Memory, which however did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happen, as appears by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Dream, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. where he is ſaid to have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, although he knew that <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he remembred him of it, ſpoke the Truth to him.</item>
                  <item>3. That they ſhould hear God, or his Angels,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58698:103"/>ſo ſpeak to them, that they ſhould be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that their Dreams proceeded from them. Now if all theſe Circumſtances concurred in a Dream, there would be no room left to doubt, but that they were divinely inſpired, eſpecially when it was a received Opinion, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty reveal'd himſelf oftentimes to Men in Dreams, admoniſhing of ſeveral things when they were aſleep, and that theſe were the true Characteriſticks of Divine Dreams.</item>
               </list>
Neither is it to be ſuppoſed, that God, who ſees and hears all things, ſhould ſuffer thoſe that love him to be impoſed upon by unclean Spirits, or even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed by the ſantaſtical Operations of Nature it ſelf, ſo as to be deceived in an Affair of this conſequence.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To come now to thoſe Divine Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances that affected them by day, and when they were awake. 2. A Voice was heard without any Reſemblance, or Image, which was enough to have awaked them, though they were aſleep. Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> being call'd by name, awaked, and diſtinctly heard the other words which God ſpoke to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. Thus likewiſe <hi>Elias</hi> heard a ſtrong and vehement Wind, overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mountains, and bruiſing the Rocks before the Lord: after this he perceiv'd a Commotion, and after that he ſaw a Fire, then he heard the whiſtling of a ſmall Wind; which being done, a Voice came to him, ſaying, <hi>What doſt thou do here,</hi> Elias? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.11. and <hi>Seqq.</hi> without any Form, or Repreſentation at all.
<list>
                  <item>2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58698:103"/>that Voice was ſent down from Heaven, as that which <hi>Abraham</hi> heard, when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſacrifice his Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. A Voice at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times did proceed neither from Heaven, or the Clouds only, but from the midſt of a Fire, or Storm, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. and 20. and no Form was diſcover'd of him that ſpoke: After this manner God ſpeaks to <hi>Job</hi> out of a Whirlwind.</item>
                  <item>4. A Reſemolance ſhowing it ſelf to Men that were awake, ſometimes diſcours'd with them, and did ſeveral things in their ſight; ſo that one Man thought he ſpoke all the while with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man; whereas it appears by what follows, and the whole Narration, that God, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, lay hid under a humane Shape, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. and elſewhere. See likewiſe <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.5. and <hi>Seqq.</hi> Oftentimes too God appear'd like a Man in Prophetical Viſions by night, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.26. I am of Opinion, that as often as we meet with this Expreſſion, <hi>and God was ſeen,</hi> as in <hi>Gen.</hi> ch. 12.7. that a humane Shape was ſeen.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have ſhown how many ſeveral ways God is ſaid to have revealed himſelf to thoſe that were aſleep, and awake; but ſo, that we did not make any Diſtinction between the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appearances, and thoſe of Angels: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for us now to enquire, by what means they cou'd ſecure themſelves from humane Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures; and next how they knew God from a Good Angel, and a Good Angel from a Bad One, whenever any of the above-mention'd Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons happen'd to them?</p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:58698:104"/>
            <p n="4">IV. That there was no humane Fraud or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture uſed, if a Voice was heard, did appear from hence.
<list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe ſometimes this Voice was much greater than a Man's; ſuch was that, which from the top of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> a very high Mountain, was on every ſide heard by the whole People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1.10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Voice of Chriſt appearing, to the Sound of a Trumpet; nay, to the Noiſe of the Sea, or a mighty River, in the 15th Verſe of the ſame Chapter.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe it came from thoſe places where no Man was, or from whence it cou'd not be ſent by Men, as when <hi>Samuel</hi> heard a Voice proceeding from the place where the Ark was, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the Clouds, and the midſt of Fire.</item>
               </list>
They ſometimes diſcover'd an Angel diſcourſing with them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a humane Shape, by the Majeſty of his Looks, and the unuſual Splendor of his Eyes. The Wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> in <hi>Jud.</hi> 13.6 <hi>The Man of God,</hi> ſays ſhe of the Angel whom ſhe ſaw, <hi>comes towards me, and his Look is like the Look of an Angel of God, very terrible.</hi> By this means <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſeems to have known the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel among the Children, whom he commanded to be thrown into the fiery Furnace: <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the fourth,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is like that of one of the Sons of God.</hi> Sometimes miraculous Actions, that were above the Power of humane Performance, were added, as not to mention any more, we may gather from the Hiſtory of <hi>Gideon, Jud.</hi> 6.17. I don't now ſpeak of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58698:104"/>Event of things foretold, for the Queſtion at preſent is, How at the very moment when an Appearance happen'd, they were able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from a humane Trick, before the Truth of thoſe things they predicted, was ratified by the Event?</p>
            <p n="5">V. The other Queſtion is much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, <hi>viz.</hi> By what means they knew, whether <hi>the Higheſt,</hi> and <hi>the God of all Gods,</hi> appear'd, or (if I may be allow'd the Expreſſion) one of the inferior Gods, or good Angels, diſpatched for that Meſſage by him? The ancient <hi>Jews</hi> don't ſeem to have ſufficiently conſidered this matter, ſince 'tis impoſſible to find out in any Narration of theſe Appearances, whether God himſelf or an Angel ſpeaks; and God and his Angels are ſaid to have appear'd promiſcuouſly in one and the ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. See <hi>Gen.</hi> ch. 16.12. ch. 22. v. 1.11, 12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2. and <hi>Seqq.</hi> So, though, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. the Lord God is ſaid to have ſpoken, yet the old <hi>Hebrews</hi> were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Law was delivered by Angels, as appears from <hi>Galatians</hi> 3.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. v. 38.53. and the reaſon of it ſeems to be this, becauſe good Angels never tell or command Men any thing in their own name, but behave themſelves as the Ambaſſadors and Miniſters of the High God. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin, Quaeſt. in Geneſ.</hi> 37. and elſewhere has obſerved, that it is not ſo much the Angel that ſpeaks, as God in the Angel. <hi>Perhaps.</hi> ſays he of <hi>Abraham, he underſtood it was God that ſpoke to him, by ſome plain and manifeſt Proofs of the Divine Majeſty.</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:58698:105"/>Which being ſo, it ſignified nothing to know whether God or an Angel ſpoke to them. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> indeed, whoſe Doctrine <hi>Jamblichus</hi> delivers in his Book of Myſteries, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Seqq.</hi> pretended to know, <hi>what was the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Token of the Preſence of God, or an Angel, or an Arch-angel, or a Daemon, or a Prince, or a Soul?</hi> This was <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s Queſtion, in which <hi>Jamblichus</hi> largely endeavours to ſatisfy him; but I ſhall not here cite thoſe Paſſages in him, not that every thing he there ſays is groundleſs and chimerical, but becauſe the Brevity of our Work will not allow us to be more prolix upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>The pious Men among the ancient <hi>Hebrews</hi> don't ſeem to have been very apprehenſive of the Frauds of Evil Angels in this Affair, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not queſtion but that the Good Angels, who were appointed by God Almighty to protect the Vertuous, wou'd fruſtrate any ſuch Deſign. And indeed it was not agreeable to the Divine Goodneſs, to expoſe thoſe that fear'd him, to invincible Temptations, which he had certainly done, if there were no exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Signs to diſtinguiſh Evil Spirits from the Good, or if thoſe Characteriſticks, which were looked upon by all Mankind to be infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of a Divine, or Angelical Apparition, might be uſurped by a wicked Power. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I will not deny, but that among a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reprobate People, whom God Almighty may be ſuppoſed to have deliver'd over to the Devil, it might ſo fall out, that unclean Spirits
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58698:105"/>ſometimes deceived them with the like Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, as we have mention'd. But this was not the caſe of the Righteous.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">I. AMong thoſe other Puniſhments which the ſacred Hiſtorians tell us the Divine
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58698:106"/>Juſtice has inflicted upon wicked Men, few of them are more wonderful than the ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the adjoyning Cities. However, the Interpreters of the Scripture, when they come to this ſurprizing Relation, ſcarce ſeem to have employ'd the care they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually beſtow upon other places. For which reaſon we judged it convenient to publiſh this Diſſertation, where we have treated this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more amply than the narrow limits of our Commentary wou'd allow. All the Tranſlators which it has been my fortuen hitherto to ſee, as if they imagined there was no difficulty in the caſe, or elſe had nothing to remark upon ſo important a Scene, barely tell us, that this Country was burnt, and ſubverted by fire from Heaven; and having done ſo, think they have diſcharged all that is required from a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The truth is, what we have heard, and imbibed from our Infancy, becomes at laſt ſo familiar to us, that we receive it almoſt without Examination. But as I have read this Hiſtory with no little Application, ſo methinks I have diſcover'd ſeveral Particulars in it worthy of Obſervation; by which not only this Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be wonderfully illuſtrated, but many other Paſſages of the H. Bible conveniently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. What we have therefore obſerved upon this Occaſion, we have thrown into the following Diſſertation; which if we have not handled with that Accuracy as the Dignity of the Subject ſeems to deſerve, yet ſince we have
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58698:106"/>done it to the beſt of our Abilities, we hope the Learned Reader will favourably receive it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Before we examine the Deſtruction it ſelf, it will be neceſſary for us to give a ſhort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Situation of <hi>Sodom, Gomorrah, Adma</hi> and <hi>Zeboim;</hi> becauſe by this means we ſhall the better underſtand how we come to ſee nothing but a ſtinking Lake, where this moſt delightful Country formerly ſtood. <hi>Moſes</hi> thus deſcribes the Situation of theſe Cities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.10. where he relates after what manner <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> parted: <hi>But</hi> Lot <hi>lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of</hi> Jordan, <hi>that it was well watered every where, before the Lord deſtroyed</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>even as the garden of the Lord, or the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>as thou comeſt unto</hi> Zoar.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place from hence we gather, that theſe Cities were ſituated on both ſides of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jordan;</hi> for <hi>the plain of Jordan</hi> is here called, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or the Valley. To make this more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, we will here ſet down the words of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who thus deſcribes it in the fifth
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58698:107"/>Book <hi>de Bello Jud.</hi> Chap. 27. <hi>Near to it,</hi>

               <hi>we find a barren Mountain, but of a vaſt length, for Northwards it reaches as far as the Country of the</hi> Scythopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litae, <hi>and towards the South it extends as far as the Land of</hi> Sodom, <hi>and the bounds of the Dead Sea. Oppoſite to it, beyond</hi> Jordan, <hi>lies a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which begins from</hi> Julias, <hi>and the Northern Country, and Southwards ſpreads as far as</hi> Somor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra <hi>which adjoins to</hi> Petra, <hi>a City of</hi> Arabia. <hi>And here too is a Mountain, called the</hi> Iron Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>which reaches as far as the Country of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab. The Valley between theſe Mountains is the ſame we are now talking of, and <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives us the following Deſcription of it. <hi>The Country which lies in the middle between theſe Mountains, is called the</hi> ΜΕΓΑΠΕΔΙΟΝ, <hi>or Great Field, and reaches from the Village of</hi> Ginnabrin <hi>to the</hi> Lacus Aſphaltites. <hi>'Tis a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred furlongs in length, and ſixſcore in breadth. The River</hi> Jordan <hi>runs through the middle of it.</hi> The ſame place, from the nature of its Situation, is call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>the Valley;</hi> although St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> in his <hi>Loci Haebraici,</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly pretends, that it is a Hebrew word. <hi>Aulon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is not a Greek word, as ſome Perſons imagine, but Hebrew: 'Tis the name of a large and ſpacious Valley of a prodigious length, which is ſurrounded on every ſide by a continued ridge of Mountains; which begin from Mount</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus <hi>and beyond it, and reach to the Deſart of</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:58698:107"/>Paran. <hi>There are ſeveral noble Cities in this</hi> Aulon, <hi>or Valley, as</hi> Scythopolis, Tiberias, <hi>and the</hi> Lake <hi>near it; nay</hi> Jericho, <hi>the</hi> Dead Sea, <hi>and all the Countries about it through which the River</hi> Jordan <hi>runs, which ariſes from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> Paneas, <hi>and ſo falls into the</hi> Dead Sea. The upper parts of this capacious Vale were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fertile, full of Paſtures, and planted with all ſorts of Trees; ſo that as <hi>Joſephus, l.</hi> 3. <hi>de Bell. Jud. cap.</hi> 4. informs us, it would invite even thoſe who are the leaſt inclined to ſuch a Life, to cultivate it. But the middle parts, except where the River <hi>Jordan</hi> water'd them, were burnt up in the Summer, as we are told by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> in the above-mentioned place. <hi>In the Summer,</hi> ſays he, <hi>all this Plain is burnt up, and by reaſon of the extream Vehemence of the Heat, the Air becomes very unhealthful, for 'tis all parch'd, but where</hi> Jordan <hi>runs; on the Banks of which River there are the moſt beautiful Groves of Palm-trees.</hi> But here we have to do with neither of theſe parts, but only with the loweſt, which reaches from <hi>Jericho</hi> to the Mountains of <hi>Idumea,</hi> where now the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites</hi> is, of which more hereafter. In the mean time, we muſt obſerve by the bye, that the Waters of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> by reaſon of the perpetual ridge of Hills that ſhut it up on every ſide from Eaſt and Weſt, had no Outlet at all, but ran to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, we muſt not lightly paſs over what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, that the Southern part of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58698:108"/>this Valley, as you go to <hi>Zoar,</hi> was watered like the Paradiſe of the Lord, or the Land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> All which words require a particular Illuſtration by themſelves; but firſt of all we will ſhow by the Teſtimony of other Writers, that this tract of Ground was exceedingly well watered, which is a thing of great importance in the preſent Diſquiſition. To begin then with the Country about <hi>Jericho: Strabo</hi> in his ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 525. of <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon</hi>'s Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Geneva,</hi> affirms, that it is plentifully ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Water. <hi>Jericho</hi> is a Plain, on every ſide ſurrounded with Hills, and in ſome parts bending like a Theatre. It abounds with Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees mixt, and ſeveral other Trees, but it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly abounds with the former. 'Tis an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Furlongs in length, and is <hi>all well watered,</hi> and full of <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> Now how this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try comes to be ſo plentifully water'd, <hi>Joſephus</hi> informs us in the above-mentioned place, in the following words: Near <hi>Jericho</hi> is a plentiful Spring, and moſt convenient for watering. We ſhall not here ſet down what he relates of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration made in this Water by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> nor what he tells us of the great Wholeſomneſs of this Well, as being borrowed from an uncertain Tradition; but thus he goes on: <hi>It waters</hi> a far greater ſpace than any <hi>other Fountain, viz.</hi> ſeventy Furlongs long, and twenty in breadth. Southwards of the Province of <hi>Jericho</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Brook, or Vale, of <hi>Kedron,</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Water from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the <hi>Dead Sea;</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:58698:108"/>but becauſe <hi>Kedron</hi> is frequently mentioned as a dry Valley, and there is ſome reaſon to doubt whether it was a Valley, or a Brook, we ſhall leave the matter undetermin'd, and proceed to the Eaſtern Bank of the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this place was a famous Fountain, called <hi>Callirrhoe,</hi> to which <hi>Herod</hi> went from <hi>Jericho</hi> when he was ſick, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, <hi>lib.</hi> 17. of his <hi>Jewiſh Antiquities,</hi> ch. 8. <hi>Croſſing</hi> Jordan he went to the hot Waters near <hi>Callirrhoe,</hi> which, beſides their Virtue in all Diſeaſes, may be ſafely drunk. This Water runs into the <hi>Dead Sea. Pliny</hi> places this Fountain on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Lake; for after he has ſaid, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. that Eaſtwards it looks upon <hi>Arabia Nomadum,</hi> and <hi>Machaerus</hi> on <hi>the South,</hi> he adds; On the ſame ſide is a hot Spring of a Medicinal Virtue, call'd <hi>Callirrhoe,</hi> denoting the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its Waters by its Name.</p>
            <p>From the Eaſt too the River <hi>Arnon</hi> falls into the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites, which ariſing in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of</hi> Arabia, as we find in <hi>Joſephus, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4. of his <hi>Jewiſh Antiquities; and running through</hi> the whole extent of the Deſart, falls into the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> and divides the Country of the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> from that of the <hi>Amorites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More to the Southward was the <hi>Brook Zered,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 21.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.13, 14. and this likewiſe ſeems to fall into the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites.</hi> From whence we may gather, that all the lower part of <hi>Jordan,</hi> where the <hi>Dead Sea</hi> now is, was not only watered with the Streams of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58698:109"/>that River, but likewiſe with ſeveral Fountains and Brooks which ran into it. Now ſince all this Water had no Inlet into the Sea, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity follow, that it was all ſwallowed up in the Sands, every way encompaſſing it, which might ſo much the more eaſily be done, becauſe the Inhabitants of hot Countries uſe to divide their Rivers into ſeveral ſmaller Branches for the benefit of their Fields; and this is the reaſon that theſe Rivers, being thus exhauſted in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are not able to carry their Waters to the Sea. We brought the like inſtance of <hi>Chryſorrhoas,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.11. I know indeed the Counterfeit <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſteas</hi> very gravely tells us, that <hi>Jordan</hi> carries its Waters into another River near the Country of the <hi>Ptolomies,</hi> which River has a Paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea. But every body knows this to be a meer Fiction, and are ſatisfied that the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites</hi> has no Outlet.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he not only informs us, that the lower-moſt part of the Plain of <hi>Jordan</hi> was well water'd; but he compares it to two well water'd places, and that part of it, which by reaſon it receiv'd ſo great Plenty of Water, was exceeding fruitful, he thus deſcribes, as the Garden of the Lord, as the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the way that leads to <hi>Zoar.</hi> This is the true Order of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s words; which if they were to be read as we find them in our Bibles, it would be an <hi>Hyperbaton,</hi> therefore they are to be placed as we have done them. For from this mountainous Country, which we have already deſcribed out
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58698:109"/>of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> pitched his Tents, when <hi>Lot</hi> parted from him, as he went to the oppoſite Hills beyond <hi>Jordan</hi> by <hi>Zoar,</hi> he firſt ſaw the Vale of <hi>Jericho,</hi> watered with a moſt plentiful Fountain, then <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Callirrhoe.</hi> Therefore this Plain by which Men went to <hi>Zoar,</hi> very well deſerved to be called well-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. An Example of the like Perturbation of the words we find in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 25.18. But if any one will not admit of a Trajection here, the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Interpreter publiſhed in the <hi>London Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glots,</hi> furniſhes us with another convenient Reading, where for <hi>Zoar</hi> we meet <hi>Zoan,</hi> that is <hi>Tanis,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 13.23. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.12. And indeed to deſcribe any well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watered place, one cou'd not produce a fitter inſtance than the <hi>Lower Aegypt,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the Road was from <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Tanis.</hi> For it was not only abundantly refreſhed with the <hi>Nile,</hi> cut into ſeveral Branches, but it was full of Lakes and Moraſſes. To confirm which Aſſertion, becauſe 'tis ſufficiently known to all that are not utterly unacquainted with the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rograpy of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> I will only alledge the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Strabo, lib.</hi> 17. <hi>p.</hi> 552. Above the <hi>Mendeſian</hi> and <hi>Tanitic</hi> Mouth of the <hi>Nile,</hi> is a vaſt Lake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the <hi>Tanitic</hi> Mouth, and the <hi>Tanitic</hi> Province, in which is <hi>Tanis,</hi> a ſamous City. Between the <hi>Tanitick</hi> and <hi>Peluſiack</hi> Mouth (through which thoſe that come from <hi>Canaan</hi> to theſe places muſt travel) there are Pools, and great and continued Moraſſes, full of Villages.</p>
            <pb n="208" facs="tcp:58698:110"/>
            <p>But 'tis wholly indifferent to us whether Lection, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the common Bibles, or that of the <hi>Syriac</hi> Interpreter, the Reader will be pleaſed to follow, provided he remembers that the Plain of <hi>Jordan</hi> is compared to the <hi>Lower Aegypt,</hi> upon the account of its well-watered Paſtures. As for the Paradiſe of the Lord, to which it is likewiſe compared, we cannot ſay any thing of it here, which we have not taken notice of in our<note n="*" place="margin">See the 12th <hi>Diſſertation.</hi>
               </note> Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>In the third place we muſt take notice, that there were <hi>Pits of Bitumen</hi> in this Tract of ground, as <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.10. where after he has related the Overthrow of the Men of <hi>Sodom, the Valley of</hi> Siddim, ſays he, <hi>was full of Slime-pits, and the Kings of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>fled, and were there deſtroyed.</hi> From this remarkable Paſſage we gather, that even before there was any ſuch thing as the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites,</hi> that Plenty of Bitumen boil'd up out of the ground, and there was uſed to be got. Which being diluted by the confluence of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Waters, it becomes Liquid, as we are told by <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 35. <hi>c.</hi> 15. though it ſeems to have been thick before, for the reaſon alledged in our Commentary. Leaſt the Reader ſhould be at a loſs, we have tranſcribed <hi>Pliny</hi>'s words, and ſome others of the like nature, concerning Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of other Authors. <q>
                  <hi>Bitumen,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which in ſome places is a Mud, in others an Earth,</hi> is a perfect <hi>Limus,</hi> or Mud, as it comes
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58698:110"/>out of the Lake in <hi>Judaea;</hi> but in <hi>Syria</hi> near a Sea-port Town, called <hi>Sidon,</hi> it is an Earth: Both of them may be made thick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. There is likewiſe a ſort of Liquid <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen.</hi> as that which comes from <hi>Zant</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. All which the Greeks call <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſphalſon,</hi> from the likeneſs of Pitch and Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</q> 
               <hi>Conſult</hi> Dioſcorides, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 99, &amp; 100. <hi>Strabo</hi> in abundance of places tells us, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen was got both out of the Earth, and out of Fountains. Theſe are his words, <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 511. Great quantities of Bitumen grow in <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> of which <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> ſpeaks after the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner. The Liquid <hi>Bitumen,</hi> which they call <hi>Naphtha,</hi> is to be found in <hi>Suſiane the dry,</hi> which will grow hard in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> a Well of which ſtuff there is near <hi>Naphtha.</hi> Conſult likewiſe what he ſays of a Fountain of Bitumen in the Province of the <hi>Apolloniata, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 219. and the ſeveral Authors cited by <hi>Iſ. Cauſaubon</hi> upon that place.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions Pits of Bitumen in the Plain of <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſo likewiſe does <hi>Herodotus, l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 119. tell us of a Pit which affords three ſorts of things, for they draw Bitumen, Salt, and Oyl out of it, after the following manner: 'Tis drawn out by a Bucket, with half a Bottle faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it, which ſerves inſtead of a Picher; this being let down into the Pit, whatever it brings up is immediately poured into a Ciſtern, and being poured out of that into another, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces three ſeveral things; it affords Bitumen
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58698:111"/>and Salt preſently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this was Liquid Bitumen; ſome of the Ancients have even ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of the <hi>Caverns</hi> from whence the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> had it dry. <hi>Curtius, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 1. There is a Cavern in that place, from which a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain throws up a prodigious quantity of Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo that 'tis manifeſtly plain that the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Walls of mighty Workmanſhip, were cemented with the Bitumen of this Fountain.</p>
            <p>This therefore was the Nature of this Soil, this the Situation of the Cities in the Plain of <hi>Jordan.</hi> Upon which it happened, as we ſhall hereafter ſee, that as the Ground ſunk down, a great Lake of Bitumen ſprung up in its room.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Soil was wonderfully fertile, by reaſon it was irrigated by the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> and the nature of the Country; ſo the lower moſt part of this large Plain was for the ſame reaſon of equal Fecundity with it. And as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> who flowed in all manner of Plenty, were addicted to all ſorts of Luſt; ſo the <hi>Sodomites</hi> and their Neighbours, by the ſame Infirmity of humane Nature, (which uſes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe God Almighty's Gifts) abandoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all the degrees of Wickedneſs, as <hi>Moſes</hi> particularly informs us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18, &amp; 19. <hi>After Men were ſatiated with good things,</hi> ſays <hi>Philo</hi> in his Book concerning <hi>Abraham, this Satiety, after the manner of the World, ſoon begot Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs.</hi> If we may take <hi>Cicero</hi>'s word for it, Men derive their Manners, not ſo much from the Seed of their Parents, as from thoſe things
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58698:111"/>which are afforded by the nature of the Soil, and our manner of Living. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were not born deceitful and Liars, but made ſo by the Nature of the place; for by reaſon of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Harbours, and their frequent Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with Merchants and Strangers, the deſire of Gain put them upon the Art of tricking and cheating. The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> inhabiting a Hilly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, were hard and clowniſh; the very Nature of their Soil taught them this, which produces nothing but with much Cultivating and Labour. The <hi>Campanians</hi> were always proud, by reaſon of the great Fertility of their Land, the Plenty of Fruits, the Wholeſomeneſs and Beauty of their City. From this Abundance and Superfluity of every thing, aroſe that Pride which diſpoſed theſe People to demand of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> that one of the Conſuls ſhould be choſen out of <hi>Capua;</hi> and afterwards that Luxury which help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ruine <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whom all the Difficulties and Fatigues of War could not conquer. <hi>Cicero</hi> argues after this rate, in his Oration <hi>de lege Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grario,</hi> delivered before the People againſt <hi>Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and likewiſe in another, which he ſpoke in the Senate-houſe: He is utterly againſt the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Colony to that place, which by reaſon of the Fruitfulneſs of the Soil, and the Plenty of all things, is ſaid to have begotten Pride and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All which things exactly proved true in the Inhabitants of the Plain of <hi>Jordan,</hi> whoſe Soil, that we may obſerve this by the by, was not unlike that of the <hi>Campanians,</hi> which to this
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58698:112"/>day abounds in Bitumen and Sulphur.</p>
            <p>Now theſe People, as they were corrupted by Proſperity, ſo it ſeems Adverſity made not the leaſt Impreſſion upon their Minds, or reform'd their Manners. Although they were conquer'd by the <hi>Etymaeans</hi> and their Confederates, which Afflictions might have awaken'd a leſs flagitious People to a Senſe of their Duty; yet it wrought not any good Effects upon theſe Debauchees, who, as ſoon as they were delivered out of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, carried their old Cuſtoms and Vices home along with them. See the 14th Chapter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.</hi> Now the Sinfulneſs of theſe People did not only conſiſt in this, that they were given to Uncleanneſs and Laſciviouſneſs, as appears from <hi>Gen.</hi> ch. 19. but in all manner of Wickedneſs. Certainly the Debauchery of that place could admit of no new Acceſſions, but was already arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to its heighth, where they cou'd think of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing Strangers after ſo abominable a manner. Therefore <hi>Joſephus</hi> deſervedly begins this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with the following words. <q>The <hi>Sodomites</hi> waxing proud for their Riches and Wealth, grew contumelious towards Men, and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards God; ſo that they were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unmindful of the Favours they received from him. They hated Strangers, and burnt in mutual Luſt with one another.</q> Hence we ſee that in the Prophets the proverbial Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of wicked Men is that of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls the People of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ch. 1.10. <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, ye Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58698:112"/>of</hi> Sodom, <hi>liſten to the Law of your God, ye People of</hi> Gomorrah. See likewiſe <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16.46. &amp; <hi>Seqq.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. And therefore the Divine Juſtice offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at theſe horrid Enormities, reſolved utterly to deſtroy ſome Cities ſituated in the fartheſt part of the Plain of <hi>Jordan,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates to have been done in the following manner; <q>
                  <hi>The Lord rained upon</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>Brimſtone and Fire from the Lord out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he overthrew thoſe Cities, and all the Plain, and all the Inhabitants of the Cities, and that which grew upon the ground,</hi> Gen. 19.24, 25.</q> We have already ſhown, that this whole Tract of Land was full of Bitumen, which as it will eaſily take fire, was ſoon kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Lightning; and the Flame was not only to be ſeen upon the Superficies of the Earth, which frequently happens in ſuch places, without the Deſtruction of the Inhabitants, but ſo pierced into the Subterranean Veins of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Bitumen, that that matter being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the whole Earth ſunk down, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a Receptacle to the Waters flowing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All which Particulars we will now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to handle more copiouſly, and to illuſtrate by other Examples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though <hi>Moſes</hi> only mentions two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which God deſtroy'd by Lightning, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> yet there were two more deſtroy'd at the ſame time, <hi>Adma</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boim,</hi> which lay near the two above-mentioned
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58698:113"/>Cities, as appears from Chapter 14.2. Nay, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf affirms as much, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.23. where taking occaſion to deſcribe the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which God would viſit the wicked <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he tells them, that Strangers as they travelled that way ſhould gaze upon their Lands, burnt up with Brimſtone and Salt, in which there ſhould be no ſowing, nor ſhould any thing grow, nor any Herb appear, as in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <hi>of</hi> Sodom, Gomorrah, Adma, <hi>and</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boim, <hi>which the Lord overthrew in his Anger and Wrath.</hi> See likewiſe <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.8. Now the reaſon why theſe two laſt Cities were omitted, ſeems to be, becauſe perhaps the Kings of theſe places were tributary to thoſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah. Strabo</hi> indeed in his ſixteenth Book does not mention that only four Cities were ſubverted by this Subterranean Fire, but thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; but perhaps he might be deceived in this matter, as well as he was in believing that the <hi>Lacus Serbonis</hi> was the ſame with the <hi>Aſphal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites..</hi> Perhaps to, nine other ſmaller Towns, which depended upon theſe four, were deſtroyed at the ſame time. 'Tis certain, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> does not only make mention of <hi>Sodom</hi> but its Daughters, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. that is, the Cities that were ſituate in the ſame Province; <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>thy Siſter</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>and the Daughters thereof,</hi> (that is to ſay, the Cities which it had built around it, or elſe ſent Colonies into) <hi>have not done as thou and thy Daughters have done.</hi> It may not improbably be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58698:113"/>ſuppoſed, that <hi>Strabo,</hi> a Man of great Diligence, and infinite Reading, might have an account of the number of theſe Cities from ſome Writer of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God is ſaid to have rained down Fire and Brimſtone from the Lord, which is a Periphraſis for Lightning, as in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9. ver. 6. He will rain Whirlwinds upon the Wicked, <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone;</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 38.22. I will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with Peſtilence and Blood: a mighty Shower, Stones of Hail, <hi>FIRE</hi> and <hi>BRIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE, will I rain down upon him.</hi> Now Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is therefore called <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, Brimſtone ſet on fire, and lighted. So in the third of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> v. 16. we find <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Conception,</hi> that is Pain which follows Conception. He that is deſirous to ſee more Examples of this nature, let him conſult <hi>H. Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> upon <hi>John</hi> 3.5. But the reaſon why Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is thus deſcribed, no one certainly can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, that has either ſmelt thoſe places that have been ſtruck by Thunder, or has read what Learned Men have writ upon this occaſion. I will only give my ſelf the trouble to ſet down two or three Teſtimonies. Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning likewiſe, ſays <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 35. <hi>c.</hi> 15. have the Smell of Brimſtone, and the very Light or Flame of them is ſulphureous. And <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the ſecond Book of his Natural Queſtions, ch. 21. tells us, that all things that are ſtruck by Lightning, have a ſulphureous Smell. And indeed, our Natural Philoſophers have plainly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58698:114"/>that the Thunderbolt is nothing elſe but a ſulphureous Exhalation. For this <hi>Perſius,</hi> in his ſecond Satire, calls it <hi>Sulphus Sacrum;</hi>

            <p>Now God is not barely ſaid to have rained down <hi>Brimſtone and Fire,</hi> but <hi>Brimſtone and Fire from the Lord;</hi> where the Addition of <hi>from the Lord,</hi> which at firſt ſight may appear to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, does more particularly deſcribe the Thunder-bolt, which by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and other Nations is frequently called the <hi>Fire of God,</hi> and <hi>Fire from God.</hi> Thus in the ſecond Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> c. 1. v. 12. <hi>THE FIRE OF GOD came down from Heaven, and devoured him.</hi> See likewiſe <hi>Job</hi> 1. v. 16. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> uſes the ſame Expreſſion, c. 66. v. 16. <hi>He ſhall be puniſhed with the FIRE OF THE LORD.</hi> After this manner the Latin Poets ſpeaks, herein intimating the <hi>Graecians;</hi> as <hi>Ovid.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though <hi>Moſes</hi> does not inform us after what manner the Thunderbolts ſubverted theſe unhappy Cities, and the adjoining Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, yet ſince he makes mention of them, we cannot comprehend how it happen'd any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than that the Thunderbolts falling in great plenty upon ſome Pits of Bitumen, the Veins of that combuſtible Matter took fire immediately, and as the Fire penetrated into the lowermoſt bowels of this bituminous Soil, theſe wicked Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſubverted by a Tremor, and ſinking down of the ground. We will not here enlarge how eaſily <hi>Naphtha,</hi> which is a ſort of Liquid Bitumen, is ſet on fire. The Reader may at his leiſure conſult what <hi>Strabo, l.</hi> 16. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Pliny, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 105. have ſaid upon this Subject. Perhaps in ſome part of this delicious Plain which was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, there was only the thick Bitumen, but
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58698:115"/>even the very Vapour of that Matter, which exhales from Grounds impregnated with it, is eaſily ſet on fire. <hi>In</hi> Lycia <hi>the Hephoeſtian Mountains if you do but touch them with a lighted Torch, immediately take fire, ſo that the very Stones in the Rivers, and the Sands in the Water burn. If you take a Stick out of theſe Waters, and draw Furrows upon the ground with it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common report, a track of Fire fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Pliny</hi>'s words, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 106. There is a ſmall Hill in the Province belonging to <hi>Grenoble,</hi> from whence a Smoke of a Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Smell is perpetually ſeen to proceed: Now this Smoke by a lighted Flambeau, or Chaff, is ſoon ſet on fire, which we our ſelves knew to be true by Ocular Experience.</p>
            <p>In that lamentable Earthquake, which in the Month of <hi>January</hi> 1693. ſhook all <hi>Sicily</hi> after ſo prodigious and miſerable a manner, ſome Authors of very good credit have aſſured us, that Thunderbolts fell in ſeveral places of the Iſland. And this Obſervation is not unknown to the Ancients; for <hi>Seneca, Quoeſt. Nat. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 30. ſays, <hi>Aetna</hi> has ſometimes burnt exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and thrown up a wonderful quantity of burning Sand, the day obſcur'd by the Smoke and Aſhes, ſo that the People were terrified at ſo unexpected a Scence of Darkneſs. At theſe times, as the common Tradition goes, there is a great deal of Thunder and Lightning.</p>
            <p>And therefore the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itumen which is ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully found in the Soil of <hi>Sodom,</hi> might be ſet
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58698:115"/>on fire by a Thunderbolt; and ſince it flows, or is dug not from the Superficies of the Earth, but from Veins of a mighty depth, when once it had taken fire the Flame muſt of neceſſity run along all thoſe Veins, and at laſt ſhake and ſubvert the ground. The ſame thing frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens to the Fields about <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> for the very ſame reaſon. Innumerable Authors have written of the Soil of <hi>Sicily,</hi> but <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſhall ſerve for all, who in the beginning of the fourth Book thus deſcribes it. The Earth is naturally thin and friable, and by reaſon of the ſeveral Caverns and Pipes, ſo penetrable, that the greateſt part of it is expoſed to the violence of the Winds. Nay, the Genius of the Soil is proper for generating and nouriſhing of Fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid to be cruſted within with Sulphur and Bitumen, which is the reaſon, that when the Wind ſtruggles with the Fire under ground, it frequently belches out ſometimes Flames, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Vapours, and ſometimes Smoke, and that in ſeveral places. <hi>Cornelius Severus</hi> proſecutes this Argument at large in his Poem, intituled, <hi>Aetna.</hi> The ſame Obſervations have been made of the Grounds that lye about the <hi>Veſuvius</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and ſeveral Towns have frequently been there overthrown by Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes. <hi>Pliny</hi> the Younger in the 16th Epiſtle, <hi>l.</hi> 6. where he relates the Death of his Learned Uncle, who was ſuffocated as he approached too near the fire of that Mountain. The Houſes, ſays he, with frequent and prodigious Tremblings
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58698:116"/>nodded, and as if they had been removed from their Foundation, ſeemed to move this way and that way. And <hi>Seneca</hi> in the ſixth Book of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Queſtions, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. has the following Paſſage. <hi>We are told</hi> that <hi>Pompeii,</hi> a famous City of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania,</hi> was ſubverted by an Earthquake. —This Concuſſion happen'd on the<note n="*" place="margin">Which is our fifth.</note> 
               <hi>Nones</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> under the Conſulate of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi> and <hi>Virginius,</hi> and occaſioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible loſſes in <hi>Campania;</hi> which though it was never free from theſe Motions, yet it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſuffer'd by them.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us happen'd to the City of <hi>Pompeii,</hi> do we ſay was the very ſame Calamity which viſited theſe Cities in the Plain of <hi>Jordan.</hi> Nor was this the firſt time that this Valley was ſhaken, as the Territory about <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peii</hi> was not ſubverted the very firſt time it ſhook, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors affirm, from whom St. <hi>Jerom</hi> has borrowed what follows in his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Traditions. <hi>It is frequently asked,</hi> ſays he, <hi>why</hi> Lot, <hi>after he had firſt prefer'd</hi> Segor <hi>to his flight up the Mountain, that he deſired it might eſcape becauſe he deſign'd to live there, ſhould ſo ſoon alter his Mind, and depart from</hi> Segor <hi>to the Mountain? We anſwer, that the Conjecture of the</hi> Hebrews <hi>concerning</hi> Segor <hi>is agreeable to the Truth,</hi> viz. <hi>that it was frequently overthrown by Earthquakes, and was firſt called</hi> Bale, <hi>and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> Saliſſa; <hi>and therefore</hi> Lot <hi>was afraid, and ſaid to himſelf, If while the other. Cities were ſtanding, this was often ſubverted, how can it now
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58698:116"/>expect to eſcape in the common ruine?</hi> But to lay aſide theſe uncertain Traditions, we will rather obſerve in the words of the <hi>Roman</hi> Philoſopher, that God puniſhed the <hi>Sodomites</hi> and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by a Calamity of a large extent, which has not only deſtroy'd ſingle Houſes, or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or Cities, but whole Nations, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times buries all in Ruines, and ſometimes in a <hi>deep Gulf,</hi> leaving no Remainders behind it. By which it may appear, that that which is not now, was formerly, but triumphs over the moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Cities, and is not ſo merciful as to leave any footſteps of their ancient Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strabo</hi> in his firſt, and <hi>Pliny</hi> in his ſecond Book, will furniſh us with ſeveral Examples of this nature; ſome few of which, nearly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Deſtruction of theſe Cities ſituate in the Plain of <hi>Jordan,</hi> we have here ſelected. The former Author tells us out of <hi>Poſidonius,</hi> p. 40. that in <hi>Phoenicia</hi> a certain City, ſituate above <hi>Sidon,</hi> was abſorpt by an Earthquake. Out of <hi>Demetrius Scepſius,</hi> that ſeveral Earthquakes have happen'd in <hi>Aſia Minor, by which whole Towns were devoured, and the Mountain</hi> Sipylus <hi>overthrown under the Reign of</hi> Tantalas, <hi>and Mariſhes turned into ſtanding Lakes.</hi> And this happen'd at the Deſtruction of the Vale of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> where the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites</hi> was occaſion'd by the Water which there overflowed. Nor indeed cou'd it otherwiſe happen, the Soil eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giving way in marſhy places. As the ſame Author tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 37. Great as well as ſmall
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58698:117"/>things may be ſwallowed up, ſince Chaſms in the Earth, and the burying of Towns and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as it happen'd at <hi>Bara, Bezona,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other places, are ſaid to be cauſed by Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes. <hi>Pliny</hi> in his ſecond Book, <hi>ch.</hi> 88. teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that the Mountain <hi>Epopos,</hi> a Fire on the ſudden breaking out of it, was levell'd to the Ground, and a Town buried in the Deep. For the Arch, that ſupported the Ground, breaking in, and the Matter underneath being wholly conſumed, the Soil above muſt of neceſſity ſink, and be ſwallowed up in theſe Caverns, if they are of a larger extent. For this reaſon 'twas ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s time that the Mountain <hi>Aetna</hi> conſumed, and ſunk by degrees, becauſe the Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors cou'd have diſcern'd it farther off in former times. See his 79th Epiſtle.</p>
            <p n="5">V. After this Territory adjoining to <hi>Jordan</hi> had thus ſunk in, it muſt unavoidably fall out, (as we ſaid before) that the Waters running to this place in ſo great an abundance muſt make a Lake of that place, which was marſhy before; as <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.3. when he relates that the Forces of the Inhabitants near <hi>Jordan</hi> met <hi>in the Valley of Siddim,</hi> which is now, ſays he, <hi>the Salt Sea;</hi> by which name, as we ſhall hereafter obſerve, the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And that this was not the only place, where a Lake was occaſioned by an Earthquake, we find from the above-mentioned Paſſage in <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo.</hi> Nay, <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifies that in one of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecuſae</hi> not only a Town was ſwallowed up in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58698:117"/>the Deep, (as we have already obſerved) but that by another Concuſſion of the Earth a Pool broke out. In the beginning of 1693. all <hi>Sicily</hi> was miſerably ſhaken; and not only ſeveral Towns overturned, but the City <hi>Auguſta,</hi> which was built by the Emperor <hi>Frederic</hi> in the Year 1229. was wholly ſwallowed up by the Sea.</p>
            <p>If to theſe Waters perpetually running into it, we add the Bitumen which at once broke out of the Earth, and mingled with the Water, we ſhall have a full Deſcription of the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites.</hi> We have evidently ſhown, that all that Country abounded with Bitumen before; and perhaps what <hi>Strabo</hi> affirms to have happen'd at <hi>Eubaea,</hi> fell out here, which did not ceaſe to feel Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings in one part or another, that the Earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the Field of <hi>Lelantus,</hi> and vomited forth a Flood of fiery Mud.</p>
            <p>After this manner the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites</hi> ſeems to be made, and nothing can be objected againſt it, unleſs it be that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not perceive the Earthquake, which we ſay happen'd in this place. For <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.27. that he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the matter, till he got up in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and went to the Mountains; from whence he ſaw the Smoke ariſe from the Earth, as from a Furnace. But beſides that, <hi>Moſes</hi> no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſenſible of this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake; it might very well be, that the Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling was very inconſiderable, or none at all in the Neighbourhood. <hi>Often ſmall Tracts of Ground are diſturbed,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> has obſerved, <hi>Quaeſt. Nat.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58698:118"/>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 25. <hi>even this Earthquake which has filled the City with ſo many dreadful Stones, did not exceed the limits of</hi> Campania. <hi>Why ſhould I mention that when</hi> Chalcis <hi>trembled,</hi> Thebes <hi>ſtood unmoleſted; that when</hi> Aegium <hi>was every moment expecting to be buried in ruines, the City</hi> Patrae, <hi>which ſtands ſo near it, felt nothing of that Motion? That prodigious Concuſſion which overwhelm'd two Cities,</hi> Buris <hi>and</hi> Helice, <hi>ſtopt on this ſide of</hi> Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um? 'Tis therefore a plain caſe, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only goes ſo far, and no farther, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns and vacant ſpaces in the Earth, <hi>give it leave.</hi> According to the Depth or Breadth of the Caverns which fell in, the Motion muſt be heard farther or nearer. Now theſe Caverns ſeem neither to have been very far from the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Earth, nor broader than the Valley which ſunk in, ſince four Cities, with the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories belonging to them, were ſo ſoon ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and yet the Calamity ſpread no farther.</p>
            <p>The Memory of this ſtrange Event was not only preſerv'd among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inhabited the neighbouring Country, but was propogated among the Heathens. <hi>Strabo</hi> indeed, <hi>l.</hi> 16. erroneouſly confounds this Lake with <hi>Sirbonis,</hi> but in the other part of his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſerves to be heard. It is a vaſt Lake, the Compaſs of which ſome Perſons eſtimate to be a thouſand Furlongs, the Length of it above two hundred, (<hi>Joſephus de Bell. Jud. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 26. tells us it is 580 Furlongs in Length, and 150 in Breadth;) <hi>the Water of it is extreamly deep
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58698:118"/>and heavy, upon which account divers are of no uſe there; for whoever goes into it as high as his Navil, is immediately lifted up. It is full of Bitumen, which at uncertain Seaſons boils up from the bottom, with Bubbels like hot Water, and then the Superficies of the Lake ſwells, and reſembles the riſing of a Hill. It emits vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of ſmoaky Aſhes that deceive the Eye-ſight; it immediately ruſts Silver and Braſs, and in ſhort, every thing that looks bright and poliſhed, except Gold alone. When their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils grow ruſty the Inhabitants know that an Eruption of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen will ſoon happen, for which reaſon they go in flat-bottom'd Boats made of Reeds to gather it.</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen is a ſort of Earth, which being melted by the Heat ſpreads mightily, but with a little cold Water is ſoon condenſed again into a ſolid Body, and therefore needs Inciſion. — Several other Signs convince us that in the Soil of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there is actual Fire, for they ſhew us rough Rocks burnt up near <hi>Moſais,</hi> and Caverns wrought out in ſeveral places, the Earth full of Aſhes; drops of Pitch diſtilling from the Rocks, the Rivers hot, and caſting forth an unſavory Smell, and their Houſes frequently thrown down; ſo that what the Natives of the place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, may very well be credited, <hi>viz.</hi> that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Cities were formerly inhabited in this Tract of Ground, the Metropolis of which, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> has ſtill the compaſs of ſixty Furlongs viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly remaining, that by Earthquakes, together with violent Eruptions of Fire, and hot bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58698:119"/>ſulphurious Water, a great Lake was made, that the Stones took fire, that ſome of the Cities were ſwallowed up, and others aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Inhabitants that cou'd make their eſcapes. <hi>Eraſtothenes,</hi> on the other hand, was of opinion, that the Country was overwhelm'd by ſtore of ſubterranean Pools. We will now introduce <hi>Tacitus</hi> to confirm what has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Strabo,</hi> who tells us in the fifth Book of his Hiſtory, <hi>ch.</hi> 6. <hi>A Lake of a mighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, reſembling a Sea, but of a more odious taſt; and for the noiſomneſs of the Smells that proceed from it, often fatal to the Inhabitants: It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agitated by the Wind, nor does it harbour any Fiſh, or Fowl accuſtomed to the Water. At certain ſeaſons of the Year it throws up Bitumen, the uſe of gathering which, Experience has taught, as it has done other Arts.— Not far from thence are Fields, which they report to have been extreamly fruitful in former times, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by large and populous Cities, but afterwards were ſet on fire by Thunder bolts, the Footſteps of which Calamity are ſtill remaining; but that the Earth, which ſeems to be parch'd and burnt up, has wholly lost its fertility. For every thing, whether it grows Spontaniouſly, or is planted by Man, whether Herb or Flower, or arrived to full maturity, if compreſs'd, moulders away immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into Aſhes.</hi> Therefore as I readily grant, that ſome famous Cities were here deſtroy'd by Lightning in times paſt, ſo I ſuppoſe, that the Earth is infected by Steams from the Lake,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58698:119"/>and the circum-ambient Air corrupted, which putrifies the Fruits of the Earth. This Lake likewiſe, has been deſcribed by <hi>Diodorus Siculus, l.</hi> 19. by <hi>Pliny, l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 16. and by <hi>Solinus, c.</hi> 36. whom the Reader, if he thinks fit, may conſult when he pleaſes. We will not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the particulars they relate, altho' we make no queſtion, but that abundance of falſe Reports have been utter'd upon this Subject. We will only enquire into the Reaſons of the ſeveral Names it goes by, with all convenient brevity.</p>
            <p>Every one knows wherefore it received the name of <hi>Aſphaltites,</hi> ſince it ſo plentifully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in <hi>Aſphaltus,</hi> or <hi>Bitumen;</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why it is frequently called the <hi>Salt Sea</hi> in Scripture, is, becauſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call all Lakes, <hi>Seas;</hi> and becauſe two other Lakes, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Semechon</hi> and <hi>Geneſareth</hi> receive the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> in his paſſage above, both which are freſh Water, therefore this third, to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from them, was called the <hi>Salt Sea.</hi> Otherwiſe the Mediterranean Sea is likewiſe ſalt; altho' 'tis certain, there is ſome difference in the ſaltneſs. In ſucceeding times, it was called the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> not becauſe the Water of it is immoveable, as <hi>Juſtin</hi> pretends, <hi>l.</hi> 36.3. but becauſe, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> informs us, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, it has no Fiſh in it. The above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Writers, that give a Deſcription of this Lake, confirm the opinion of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> to whom we will add two Eye-witneſſes: Firſt, <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:58698:120"/>who in his fifth Book expreſly tells us, he ſaw the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> which runs thro' the Lake of <hi>Tiberias, fall</hi> into another Lake, called the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> by whom it is <hi>conſumed;</hi> and afterwards adds, <hi>This Lake is void of Fiſh, who turn back to their accuſtomed Waters, as from a manifeſt Danger.</hi> The Second is, St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who upon the 47th. Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> If <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſwelled by the Rains, carries any fiſhes into it, they immediately die, and float upon the ſurface of the fat Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. So much concerning the Lake. Now let us proceed to ſay ſomething of its Banks, and the circumjacent Country; beſides what we have already related of it by the by. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> ſpeaking of the Territory about <hi>Sodom,</hi> thus expreſſes himſelf: Near this Lake, ſays he, is <hi>Sodomitis,</hi> formerly a delicious and fertile Land, and famous for the Riches of its Cities, but now wholly burnt up. After this he goes on in the following words; ſo that you'd rather think, that <hi>Tacitus,</hi> or any Pagan Author ſpoke, rather than <hi>Joſephus. The Reports run,</hi> That for the wickedneſs of the Inhabitants it was deſtroy'd by Thunderbolts. Indeed the remainders of the Divine Fire, and the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of five Cities, are ſtill to be ſeen; the ſight of which, gives credit to the Stories that are told of the Country about <hi>Sodom.</hi> After the ſame manner, <hi>Philo,</hi> towards the end of his ſecond Book, concerning the Life of <hi>Moſes. The</hi> Monuments of that unſpeakable Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58698:120"/>are to this day ſhown in <hi>Syria;</hi> Ruines, Aſhes, Brimſtone, Smoak, and a ſlender ſmall Flame ſtill breaking forth, certain indications of Fire.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Jude,</hi> in the 7th. verſe of his Epiſtle, ſeems to have his Eye upon this, where he ſays, that <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the neighbouring Cities, are propoſed as a Spectacle, bearing the puniſhment of everlaſting Fire. This Fire, which for ſo many Ages was fed by the Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Matter, and perhaps ſtill continues, is called <gap reason="foreign">

            <q>Thou haſt drunk Fire out of immortal Cups.</q>
            <p>Learned Men are miſtaken, who imagine, that this fire which burnt down the Cities of this famous Valley, was therefore called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe 'tis a Figure of Eternity; or becauſe it was not extinguiſhed till it had deſtroy'd every thing; for it flamed long after that, and both Interpretations are unnatural. Nor is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Man Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> happier in his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58698:121"/>Conjecture than the reſt, who is of opinion, that the eternal Pains of Hell are here ſignified; as likewiſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.8. and ſeveral other places of Scripture. In the firſt place he tells us, that <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> are here put for the Inhabitants of thoſe Cities. Secondly, he obſerves, that a preſent Puniſhment is meant here; ſince the Apoſtle ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they are propoſed as a Spectacle, altho he had uſed the Praeterperfect Tenſe before; from whence he concludes, that we are to underſtand this of the Damned in Hell, for as much as the other Fire was paſt and gone. However, the Monuments of that Puniſhment, as we have already taken notice, ſtill continued; nor cou'd the <hi>Sodomites</hi> be ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be propoſed as a Spectacle, <hi>qui</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>non poterant, i. e.</hi> who cou'd not be ſhewn. Therefore our Interpretation is the moſt ſimple and agreeable to the Words; which being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, we may ſtill ſay, that the Puniſhment of Cities deſtroy'd, are ſtill left to be ſeen by us. <hi>Brocardus</hi> indeed, in his Deſcription of the Holy Land, Part the firſt, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. § 25.

Since it is moſt probable, that theſe Cities of the Plain of <hi>Jordan,</hi> were overthrown in the ſame manner, as we have related it: However, ſome inquiſitive Reader may be ſtill inclined to ask, whether we ſuppoſe the Ground was burnt and ſubverted by Miracle, or only by the common methods of Nature. <hi>Seneca</hi> was of opinion, that the Gods never concerned themſelves in any thing of this kind; and that the diſorders of Heaven nor Earth, were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the anger of the Deities. Thoſe things, ſays he, are produced by their own Cauſes; neither do they rage, becauſe they are commanded ſo to do, but when they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, it proceeds from ſome failing or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, as it happens with human Bodies;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58698:124"/>and then, when they chiefly ſeem to give an injury, they receive one. But to us, who are ignorant of the true Cauſe, every-thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears frightful, and our apprehenſions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the rarity of them. But to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Rhetorical Figures, which only amuſe and deceive ignorant People; the thing itſelf, if we conſider it diveſted of all Circumſtances, does not ſeem to exceed the ordinary power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as we have ſufficiently demonſtrated from ſeveral Inſtances of Earthquakes. In a Soil, impregnated with Bitumen, which is above, may be ſhaken and ſwallowed up with a ſudden <hi>hiatus.</hi> Thunder-bolts too may fall, and ſet the veins of Sulphur and Bitumen on fire, which afterwards breaking out, and mingled with the Water, may in a low Valley, eaſily cauſe a Lake full of <hi>Aſphaltus.</hi> But if theſe things were done before the natural Cauſes were in a diſpoſition to produce this Effect, and had not happened at that inſtant, unleſs it had been for ſome extraordinary Intervention of God, or his Angels; it ought to be no leſs reputed a Miracle, than if every particular in the Tranſaction, plainly ſurpaſſed the uſual order of Nature.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58698:125"/>the celebrated <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife; For, as we have demonſtrated in the foregoing Diſſertation, that thoſe Cities ſituated near <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> were by an unuſual divine Power, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed and buried in Ruins; ſo, on the other hand, we hope we ſhall be able to convince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unprejudiced Reader in this; that ſome perſons, out of too fond a regard to Miracles, by miſunderſtanding the words of the Holy Scriptures, have improv'd an event, which we own to be ſomewhat uncommon, into a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prodigy. The <hi>Jews,</hi> who were always a people ſo ſottiſhly abandon'd to the belief of Miracles, that not being content with the Truth, they trumpt up a Thouſand other Legends ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, of which the Bible makes not the leaſt mention, ſeem to have miſled the Chriſtians into this Error; and they, by following their blind Guides with too implicit a Reſignation, imagin'd after the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was turn'd into a Pillar of Salt; tho' ſo wonderful a Change, cannot certainly be deduced from the words of <hi>Moſes.

Let us for a while, lay aſide their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of which we ſhall treat hereafter; and examine <hi>Moſes</hi>'s words, which gave occaſion to this Opinion. <hi>Lot</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, looked back, Vatthebi ntſib melahh,</hi> and became a Pillar of Salt.

            <p>The firſt of them in this place, may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie two things,

Such a heap is call'd <hi>Matt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebah,</hi> a word of near affinity to this, which ſignifies any thing that is rais'd up. For This reaſon, D. <hi>Kimchi</hi> ſeems to interpret it <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>thal,</hi> and upon this conſideration, perhaps, or from the relation of thoſe perſons, who ſaid, they had ſeen it, <hi>Sulpitiùs Severus,</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife to be turned into a heap of Stones. They
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58698:126"/>were forbidden (theſe are his words) to look behind them, but the Woman not regarding this prohibition, as 'tis the infirmity of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to long more earneſtly after forbidden things, turned back her Eyes, and is reported to have been immediately changed into a Heap.</item>
                  <item>2. It may ſignifie a Statue or Pillar: The LXX Interpreters have Tranſlated it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Salt, St. <hi>Jerome</hi> a Statue, and <hi>Onkelos</hi> the ſame. From which Ambiguity of the Words it has happen'd, that ſome wou'd have <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife turn'd into a Pillar, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a feminine Shape, but others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it to have been the Statue of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, wherein all her Liniaments were plainly to be ſeen, as we ſhall obſerve hereafter.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides theſe proper Significations, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may in a figurative Senſe, be applied to ſignifie ſomething <hi>immoveable</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> like a Pillar, or Statue; whence the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Nitsbelha</hi> in <hi>Chaldee,</hi> ſignifie Hardneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.41. Nay the word <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore this may be the meaning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife grew ſtiff, and remain'd there motionleſs, like a Pillar or Statue; as we ſhall more fully prove anon. Thus in common Converſation we are uſe to compare ſtupid Men, that are gazing at any thing long in the ſame poſture of Body, to Statues. <hi>Philo</hi> in his Book <hi>de Profugis,</hi> where he interprets this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58698:127"/>in an Allegorical manner, not Unelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, uſes the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical Senſe: He ſays, that thoſe who leave the things before them, and turn their necks, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Melahh,</hi> beſides its common ſignification of <hi>Salt</hi> properly ſo called, has two other meanings in Scripture. Sometimes it ſignifies a ſalt and barren Soil, like that about the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites,</hi> as we find in <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 29.23. All his Land ſhall be Brimſtone, Salt and Combuſtion, it ſhall not be ſown, nor yield Fruit, nor ſhall any Herb grow therein, as in the Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom, &amp;c.</hi> In other places this ſort of Soil is called <hi>Melhha,</hi> as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107.34. and the LXX Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters render it by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; in which Senſe, if it is here underſtood, the Prepoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (which is frequently left out, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12.) is wanting, and then it will run thus, <hi>And ſhe was a Statue,</hi> or in other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew words, <hi>they ſtood</hi> or <hi>remained a Statue in a ſaltiſh Soil.</hi> Sometimes it ſignifies a long ſpace of time, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.19. This ſhall be a Covenant of Salt, or an everlaſting Covenant
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58698:127"/>to thee. We meet the ſame Expreſſion, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.5. Now Salt ſeems to be a ſymbol of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe things that are ſeaſon'd with it, continue incorrupt for many Years; which perhaps is the reaſon why this word is uſed to ſignifie duration of time. And if this ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be admitted, <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to have continued always in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or there to have been benumo'd, and never to have return'd back.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee there is nothing in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s words which obliges us to ſuppoſe, that any unuſual <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> happen'd in this caſe, in order to find out any meaning in them; and yet we ought not to have recourſe to this ſorry ſhift, unleſs after a diligent inquiry into the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Words, we were convinced they cou'd bear no other meaning: For ſince thoſe Prodigies, which are above the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, very rarely happen, in compariſon of thoſe that may be effected by it; we ought ſeldom to admit of any Miracle in the Interpretation of Scripture, unleſs there be an urgent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. When God is pleaſed to work any <hi>Mird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> that is, ſomething which cannot be done according to the Rules of Nature, as they were at firſt eſtabliſh'd; there is ſome important Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the All-wiſe Governour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe neglects the Laws of Nature, and makes uſe of his infinite Prerogative; becauſe it is by no means conſiſtent with his Wiſdom, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58698:128"/>to break that Order for trivial Cauſes, which he at the Creation inſtituted with the higheſt Reaſon. Now if we carefully examine this wonderful <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, we ſhall find nothing in this whole affair that ſeems to deſerve ſo great a Miracle. 'Twas enough that this undiſcreet Woman was puniſhed by Death for her Dilatorineſs; nor did the Angels threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to inflict any thing beyond this, <hi>ſave thy life,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and don't look behind thee, nor tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Plain, but fly to the Mountain, leaſt thou ſhould'ſt periſh.</hi> Nor was there the leaſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for a Miracle to deſtroy her, as we ſhall preſently demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Who can digeſt this abſurd turning of her into Salt? where any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is related in Scripture, there are evident convincing Reaſons, why ſuch and ſuch Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and no other, ſhould be wrought. A Man of the meaneſt capacity knows why <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Rod was changed into a Serpent, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Wine, at the Marriage in <hi>Cana.</hi> But here, if we were to reſign our Faith up blindly to the Interpreters, a ſtrange and ſudden Change is wrought for no reaſon at all; for I wou'd willingly be inform'd, why <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn'd into Salt, than into a Stone.</p>
            <p>Some People pretend this was done, becauſe the Earth itſelf being converted into Salt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. emitted a ſaline Vapour, which penerating the fleſh of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe was immediately, turn'd into Salt.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58698:128"/>But thoſe that have diligently examin'd the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Salt tell us, that this terreſtrial Salt is <hi>fixt,</hi> as the Chymiſts expreſs it; that is, does not ſpend itſelf in Vapours. Nevertheleſs, ſhou'd we grant what they ſo confidently affirm, yet a human Body, tho' it were never ſo much impregnated with thoſe Vapours, wou'd not on the ſudden be changed into Salt. Beſides, tho' the Earth where <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife periſhed, is ſaid to be Salt, yet it abounds in a far greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Bitumen and Brimſtone; ſo that if ſhe were to be changed into ſome Matter of near affinity with that Earth, ſhe might much more conveniently have been turn'd into a Fountain of Bitumen or Brimſtone.</p>
            <p>Others, in which number we find <hi>Clem. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi> give us a myſtical Reaſon why ſhe was turn'd into Salt. <hi>Lot</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> ſays he, who of her own accord alone relapſed to the vices of the World, he left ſenſeleſs, and made her as it were a Stone of Salt, and commanded her to go no farther: No inſipid, or unprofitable I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, but to ſeaſon and whet up thoſe who have a Spritual Diſcernment, <hi>Strom. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 387. We meet with the ſame ſtrain of Reaſoning in St. <hi>Auſtin, de Civ. Dei. lib.</hi> 16. <hi>c.</hi> 3. But any one may ſee how far fetched and Oratorical this ſort of Argumentation is, it may ſerve well enough for the Pulpit, or a popular Harangue, but can never ſatisfie a Philoſophical Ear, which is not to be impoſed upon by ſuch miſerable Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</p>
            <pb n="246" facs="tcp:58698:129"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is of opinion, that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was burnt by Fire, which had ſome Salt mixt with it, ſo that ſhe was as it were ſeaſoned by that Salt; and he endeavours to prove that Salt fell down from Heaven with the Fire, which was likewiſe the ſentiment of <hi>H. Grotius,</hi> from <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>v.</hi> 22. But <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks not a ſyllable of any Salt falling down from Heaven, neither can it be deduced from his words, as any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reader will ſoon diſcover, or might know from what has been already ſaid. But how this burnt Soil came to be ſaltiſh, we ſhall ſhew in our Annotations upon that place of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> We may likewiſe add to what has been mention'd above, againſt thoſe Gentlemen who maintain, that this Statue of Salt has laſted for ſo many thouſand Years; that altho' it were made of Salt, which equall'd that which is ſoſſil in hardneſs, yet being expos'd ſo long to the open Air, cou'd not have laſted ſo long. The hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Marble cou'd ſcarce have ſuffer'd the force of the Air, of heat, and cold, and rain, and wind, without being conſiderably injured. They that pretend it was preſerv'd by a Miracle, are ſo accuſtom'd to defend uncertain Miracles, by more uncertain ones, and are ſo ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the moſt cogent Reaſons in the World, that 'tis not worth the while to confute them.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince ſo many monſtrous Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities ſtare us in the Face, if with the generality of Mankind, we admit of a <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> here, and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s words will very well allow of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58698:129"/>meaning, 'tis more preferable in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to have recourſe to that, eſpecialy if 'tis more agreeable to Reaſon. Nay, tho' the Words of the ſacred Hiſtorian were wreſted a little, which we have not done, as is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent already, and will be made more plain hereafter. It were better to father a hard In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation upon them, than to introduce him ſpeaking Abſurdities. 'Tis certainly much more credible, that <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed an improper Phraſe, than that he deliver'd plain downright Incongruities, and therefore a forced Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation wou'd be infinitely more tolerable, than to feign a prodigious Event, meerly for the ſake of expounding two poor doubtful words at beſt.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. But we are oppoſed, they ſay, by the Authority of the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ſome Citations out of whom we will produce, beſides thoſe we have already brought, leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one ſhould ſuppoſe, that we purpoſely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt or omitted them.

The ancienteſt Chriſtian who has mentioned this Charge, ſeems to be <hi>Clemens</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> his Wife, ſays he, went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, but being of a different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not perſiſting in concord, was therefore placed for a Sign, and continues a Statue of Salt to this very day. <hi>Irenaeus, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 51. has the ſame and ſomething more, as we ſhall ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: 'Tis to no purpoſe to alledge the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of thoſe of a later ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Now all that can be gathered from theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, is only this, that the <hi>Jews</hi> and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Chriſtians</hi> believed this <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, which we don't deny; but it does not therefore follow that we are obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, becauſe indeed they borrow'd this Opinion from no where elſe but the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> miſunderſtood, and not from the ſight of this Statue, as we ſhall prove hereafter. Now as they might eaſily be miſtaken in interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they were in many other things beſides, ſo we are by no means engaged to take their Words in this affair. For all the Authors that 'tis poſſible to cite upon this occaſion, lived in thoſe times, wherein no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Monuments were extant, from whence they might better diſcover the truth of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58698:130"/>than we at this great diſtance can do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Nor were the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Interpreters, or thoſe that follow them, ſo profoundly verſed in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, that 'twas not poſſible for 'em to miſtake <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s meaning, as we have ſhown the contrary in ſeveral places of our Commentary: and as for the Moderns, their Authority is of much leſs weight, ſince 'tis a plain caſe, that they were furniſhed with no better helps to find out the Senſe of the Scriptures than we are: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the numbers of thoſe that are of a contrary Opinion to us, ought not to be brought as an Argument, becauſe after the Septuagint had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd this Miſtake in their Verſion, all the reſt blindly follow'd them, without even exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the matter. <hi>What one Man has ſaid,</hi> they are the words of a great Man, <hi>All believe and no one queſtions it;</hi> and therefore if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the buſineſs aright, only his Authority ought to be weighted in the Ballance who firſt advanced this Opinion, and if that proves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Examination to be none of the beſt, as we hope we have ſufficiently evinced, then there is no reaſon why we ſhould rely upon it.</p>
            <p n="5">V. But perhaps ſome may be of Opinion, that we loſe time in ſeeking to leſſen the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Ancients, ſince we have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their great Learning to encounter, but the Teſtimonies of ſeveral Eye-witneſſes, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> for inſtance, and ſome Moderns; by whoſe Authority rather then the Expoſition of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58698:131"/>words, this Opinion has found credit enough to laſt ſo many Ages. But we are in hopes to ſolve this Argument with as little Difficulty as we did the former, and if the Reader will be pleas'd carefully to conſider what we ſay, we don't doubt but he will acknowledge as much.</p>
            <p>The Teſtimonies of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and all the reſt, may be confuted by one ſingle Argument, which we ſhall firſt make uſe of, tho' we intend to examine the matter more diligently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. All that pretend they have ſeen the Statue, that we may for once grant that they ſaw ſomething, might be deceived by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the place, who perhaps ſhow'd them a Stone, or ſomething like one, and then very poſitively affirm'd it was <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife; for how cou'd they know whether they were told the Truth or no? Therefore they had behaved themſelves more diſcreetly in my opinion, if they had written that they ſaw a Pillar, a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or ſomething like it, which the Inhabitants called <hi>a Statue</hi> of Salt, but that they cou'd not tell whether it was really ſo or no.</p>
            <p>And indeed, ſuch a Caution or Conduct was the more neceſſary in this Country, becauſe the People of it were more guilty than any other Nations, of impoſing old names upon new things, meerly to deceive the lovers of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. From Reading the Bible, and not from any Tradition of their Anceſtors, they were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to gueſs where every thing of Importance was done, and ſo ſhow'd to Strangers who came
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58698:131"/>to viſit theſe places, the Footſteps of ancient things, which they themſelves had deviſed. And this is the Reaſon, that whenever they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to miſunderſtand the Scripture, they blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the ſituation, and ſeign things that were never <hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> as they do ſtill to this very day. Thoſe that have turn'd over the Writings of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and ſome Itineraries of the Holy Land, are no doubt on't, ſenſible how true this Allegation is. But to make the matter plain, beyond any poſſibility of denying it, we will produce a few Examples out of the vaſt number that offers itſelf. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his <hi>Epitavium</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A Noble Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of <hi>Rome,</hi> that went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Paulae,</hi> deſcribing her Travels through <hi>Judaea, In the Shore of</hi> Sarepta, ſays he, <hi>ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the little Tower of</hi> Elias. Now can any Man of tolerable Senſe believe, that the Cottage where the poor Widow of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta</hi> entertained <hi>Elias</hi> formerly, ſhould be ſtanding ſo many Ages after? nor is there any more reaſon to believe, that at <hi>Caeſarea, The Houſe of</hi> Cornelius <hi>the Centurion, the little</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Aediculae.</note> 
               <hi>Cells of</hi> Philip, <hi>and the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambers of the four Virgin Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes;</hi> and at <hi>Emmaus, the Houſe of</hi> Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, were ſtill remaining; and yet all theſe things were ſhown to <hi>Paula</hi> with a world of Aſſurance. The ſame Lady not only ſaw the Sepulchre of Chriſt, but likewiſe <hi>kiſſed the Stone of the Reſurrection, which the Angel remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the door of the Monument, and with
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58698:132"/>her faithful Mouth licked the place where our Lord's Body lay.</hi> Afterwards ſhe was ſhown <hi>a Pillar, ſupporting the portico of a Church, ſtain'd with the Blood of our Saviour, to which he was ſaid to be bound, and whipt; and the place where the Holy Ghost deſcended upon the Souls of a Hundred and twenty Believers.</hi> Then ſhe went forward to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and <hi>on the right ſide of the way, ſtood near the Sepulchre of</hi> Rachel; having entred into <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſhe viſited our Saviour's<note n="*" place="margin">Specus.</note> Cave, and ſaw <hi>the Holy Inn of the Virgin.</hi> In another part of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> ſhe entred into <hi>the Cells of</hi> Sarah, <hi>ſeeing the place where</hi> Iſaac <hi>was born</hi> (who you muſt know paſs'd all their Lives under Tents) <hi>with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Oak.</hi> Then ſhe went into the <hi>Sepulchre of</hi> Lazarus, <hi>and beheld the Inn where</hi> Mary <hi>and</hi> Martha <hi>dwelt.</hi> I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in no more, ſince theſe are ſufficient to ſhow that credit is to be given to thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ſhow every thing with that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exactneſs; perhaps ſome Perſons, with whom Credulity and Faith paſs for one and the ſame thing, will maintain, that all theſe things were truly ſhown to <hi>Paula,</hi> but we have all along profeſs'd, that we don't write to Gentlemen of ſo voracious a Belief, who will with as much obſtinacy combat Truth and Reaſon, as they ſwallow fooliſh Stories with eaſe.</p>
            <p>If we were to gather ſuch ſort of Stories out of the Modern Itineraries, it would require no great trouble to collect them, ſince they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58698:132"/>fill both ſides of the Page in moſt of them. Let the Reader only conſult <hi>Bellonius</hi> and <hi>Thevenot,</hi> whoſe Obſervations we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made uſe of, when they deſcribe the Holy Places, and if he is not as heartily weary of them, as ever he was of the moſt inſufferable talkative Coxcomb in the World, I will give him leave to apply my Writings to what uſe he pleaſes. I have already declared, that I don't write <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to unthinking Creatures, who will admit and reject whatever they think fit, without any Reaſon on their ſide. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I cannot forbear to Tranſcribe one exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fooliſh Paſſage out of <hi>Bellonius,</hi> to ſhow how prettily theſe Holy Jugglers banter poor credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Stangers out of the Bible: He tells us, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. that among other things that are to be ſeen without <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they ſhow in the City Wall, <hi>a triangular Stone, which they ſay is the very ſame which the Scripture mentions,</hi> Pſal. 118. v. 22. <hi>viz.</hi> the Builders refuſed; I humbly ſuppoſe there is no occaſion to ſhow how monſtrouſly abſurd this is.</p>
            <p>Now to return to the Statue of Salt, we ſhould not think our ſelves guilty of ill Manners, ſhould we ſuſpect that <hi>Joſephus</hi> did not ſee ſo much as the leaſt reſemblance of a Statue, altho' we by no means deſpiſe that Writer, eſpecially when he comes to the latter part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory, yet we wou'd never engage in ſo unſteoenable a Province, as to quit from the Imputation of being ſometimes a Fable-monger. In the firſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58698:133"/>Book of his Antiquities, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. he tells us, that <hi>Adam</hi> having foretold, that there wou'd be a Deſtruction of all things, one by Fire, and t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Water, the <hi>Antediluvians</hi> built two Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, one of Brick, and the other of Stone, and Engraved all their uſeful Inventions upon each of them, that if the Brick Pillar happen'd to be carried away by the Inundation, the Stone Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar remaining, might preſerve theſe Monuments for the uſe of Poſterity. He tells us after all, that this Stone Pillar was ſtill extant, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in the Land of</hi> Sirias; where this Land of <hi>Sirias</hi> lies ('tis to be ſuppoſed, not far from the Iſle of <hi>Pines</hi>) we will not here enquire, but few, I am apt to think, will be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with themſelves to believe that this <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian</hi> Pillar was ſtanding in <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s time. But if this does not argue the Fabulouſneſs of a Writer, and his Friends alledge for him, that he was impoſed upon by the Relations of other Men, let us hear him deſcribe the <hi>Fluvius Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baticus,</hi> or <hi>Sabbath River, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>de Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Judaico.</hi> He tells us, that <hi>Titus,</hi> as he Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd through <hi>Syria,</hi> ſaw a River worthy ones taking notice of, which runs between <hi>Arcae</hi> and <hi>Raphonaeae,</hi> two Cities belonging to the Kingdom of <hi>Agrippa:</hi> When it runs, it has a very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and quick Stream, but for the ſpace of ſix days, as if the Fountains fail'd it above, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together dry; on the ſeventh day it has a brisk Current again, and this order 'tis obſerved to keep. If <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaw the Statue of Salt no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58698:133"/>better than he did <hi>Titus</hi>'s Sabbath-River, we need not uſe many words to diſprove and invalidate his Teſtimony: See <hi>Ludolphus</hi> largely diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this matter, with great variety of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in his Commentary upon the <hi>Aeth. Hiſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Num.</hi> 68.</p>
            <p>But 'tis pretended, that among the reſt that viſited theſe Places, and affirm the Pillar to be ſtill ſtanding, and are cited for that purpoſe, we find <hi>Benjamin Tudelenſis,</hi> and the Lord knows who, one <hi>Bernardus Solignacus.</hi> As for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he no where tells us that he beheld this Statue, for theſe are his words, <hi>From the Sea of</hi> Sodom <hi>to the Statue of Salt, which was</hi> Lot<hi>'s Wife, 'tis two Leagues. The flocks of Cattle lick of it, but ſtill it growes again as before.</hi> 'Twas never my fortune to meet the laſt, but what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows will ſufficiently ſhow that he either told a Story of his own inventing, or was deceiv'd by others. <hi>Doubdanus,</hi> a Canon of St. <hi>Denys,</hi> who Printed an Account of the Holy Land at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1666. informs us, what the honeſter Men in thoſe Countries think of the matter, <hi>p.</hi> 338. <hi>Some will pretend,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that there is a great Stone of Salt to be ſeen, which they take for</hi> Lot's <hi>Wife,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the modern People cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it cou'd last ſo long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we will but hear ſome of them who actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Survey'd theſe places, and were able to ſee nothing of the matter, but tell us what Stories they heard from other People, it will ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what credit is to be given to theſe Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58698:134"/>Thus therefore <hi>Brocardus</hi> in his Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Land, Part I. <hi>ch.</hi> 7. § 34. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> is ſituated under the Mountain <hi>Engaddi,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which and the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> is the Pillar of Salt, into which <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was turned. I gave my ſelf the fatigue of a very troubleſome Journey to behold this Statue, but was not ſo happy as to ſatisfie my Curioſity; for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants aſſur'd me the place was inacceſſable, or that it could not be viſited without apparent danger of Death, by reaſon of the prodigious Beaſts and Serpents that abounded there, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for the <hi>Biduini</hi> that dwell upon the place, a Savage and Inhumane <hi>ſort of People.</hi> We can eaſily ſuppoſe that he endeavoured in vain to ſee the Statue of Salt, but if there was any ſuch thing <hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> it ought to have been looked after on the other ſide of the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites,</hi> or beyond the Eaſtern Banks of it, where <hi>Segor</hi> or <hi>Zoar</hi> ſtood: 'Twill not be amiſs to prove the Truth of this Aſſertion in a few Words.

It has been long ago obſerved by ſome Judicious Perſons, that Orators are allow'd to take ſome liberty in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58698:136"/>Hiſtory, that they may be able to ſay ſomething fine and <hi>Elegant.</hi> Now this manner of Death for <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, was capable of all the Beauties of Rhetorick and Strains of Tragedy; but the common Death as we have ſaid is deſcribed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> afforded little or no matter for Pomp and Ornament.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be the reaſon, why ſome of our Modern Writers of Travels have given an Account of what they never ſaw, not to take notice, that perhaps they were aſhamed to ſay, they had not ſeen that, which others who had been in thoſe Parts pretended to have ſeen, leaſt the World ſhould take them not to have made a true uſe of their Travels. <hi>Chriſtopher Fure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> a Noble-man of <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe Travels of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and the neighbouring Countries, were Printed at <hi>Nurimberg,</hi> in the Year 1621. affirms, that he waſhed his Hands in the <hi>Lacus Aſphal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,</hi> and found that the taſte of it was very naſty, and more ſaltiſh then ever he found; but be makes not the leaſt mention of the Statue of Salt. <hi>Bellonius</hi> was in the Province of <hi>Jeriche</hi> about <hi>Jordan,</hi> and deſcribes all the Nations about it, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 86. but is ſilent as to this wonderful Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; whether he had heard nothing concerning it, or was of opinion that the common Reports were falſe. You'll find <hi>Thevenot</hi> does the ſame, if you read <hi>ch.</hi> 41. <hi>l.</hi> 2. Part I. of his Travels into the Eaſt. Nay, <hi>Nicholas Chriſtopher Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zivil,</hi> a Poliſh Prince, who Survey'd theſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with all the exactneſs imaginable, I inquired,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58698:136"/>ſays he, very carefully of our <hi>Arabian,</hi> and thoſe that are well skill'd in our Country, who all of them affirm'd, that nothing like it was there to be found.</p>
            <p>To return now to the more ancient Times, we might to theſe Witneſſes add St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who lived ſo many Years in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and took no little care to divulge things of this Nature, and yet he never makes the leaſt mention of this Statue of Salt, altho' he takes notice of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Sodom,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> nay even of his Wiſe too. Thoſe that are acquainted with his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and know what Pains he takes to ſhow his own wit even upon the names of Places, and other Witticiſms, tho' never ſo far fetched, are no doubt on't ſenſible, that he wou'd never have loſt ſo Glorious an opportunity as this everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Statue afforded him to exerciſe his Talent upon; if any one had preſumed to affirm, that ſo remarkable a Monument was extant in his Time. In his Epitaph of <hi>Paula,</hi> where he hunts after Myſteries from every place which ſhe ſaw, or even beheld at a diſtance, he loſt the beſt opportunity of ſhowing his Wit, that he could have deſired, if at that time this Famous Statue was to be ſeen. <hi>As ſoon as the</hi> Sun was up, ſays he, ſhe ſtood upon the Brow of <hi>Caphar Baracha,</hi> that is the Town of Benediction, to which place <hi>Abraham</hi> followed the Lord; from whence ſhe beheld a vaſt Solitude, and the Ground where formerly <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Adma</hi> and <hi>Zeboim</hi> ſtood. She view'd the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58698:137"/>of Balſam in <hi>Engaddi</hi> and <hi>Segor, vitulaus conteruantem,</hi> which was formerly called <hi>Bale,</hi> and was in the <hi>Syrian</hi> Dialect Tranſlated into <hi>Zoar,</hi> that is, a little one. She remembred the Cave of <hi>Lot</hi> (and why not the Statue of Salt, if it was ſtill remaining) and ſhedding Tears, admoniſhed her Virgin Companions to abſtain from Wine, the unlucky Parent of Luxury. If the Statue of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife had been then believed to be on the other ſide of the <hi>Lacus Aſphaltites,</hi> how opportunely might he have introduced <hi>Paula,</hi> admoniſhing her Companions to eſchew Earthly things, and not to look back. In his Epiſtle to <hi>Ruſticus,</hi> tho' he makes mention of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, yet he ſays no more of her than that diſordered by Deſpair, and looking behind her, ſhe was condemn'd to wear an everlaſting Mark of her Infidelity. In his Commentary upon <hi>Amos, c.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Lot,</hi> ſays he, was ſaved, tho' <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> was deſtroyed, loſing the part and ſubſtance of his Body, by which we underſtand <hi>his Wife;</hi> and yet this perpetual affecter of Allegories, ſays no more of her. All which Circumſtances clearly ſhow, that in St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s time no body believed that this Statue of Salt was then Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And indeed we have no Arguments to prove ſhe was turn'd into a Statue; 'tis far more probable, that the Woman either grew benum'd by fear, or elſe was ſuffocated by ſome Bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous or Sulphureous Vapour. When ſhe ſaw her native Country deſtroy'd by Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58698:137"/>and Earth, with a dreadful Noiſe, the Ground trembling under her Feet, and ſhe recollected in her mind the ſad Deſtiny that befel all her Friends and Relations, except her Husband and two Daughters; What wonder is it if Grief and Fear ſo poſſeſt her Spirits, that ſhe immediately expired, or at leaſt fainted away, and no one being by to aſſiſt her in that <hi>deliquium,</hi> died up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpot. <hi>Plutarch in Sympos, L.</hi> 4. <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. affirms, that ſeveral Perſons have been killed meerly with the fright of Thunderbolts: <hi>Add to this,</hi> ſays he, the Conſternation and Fear, by which abundance of Men that ſuffered not the leaſt Injury have been carried off, only by their being too apprehenſive of Death. Great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have been kill'd by Thunder, who have not any Footſteps of being ſtruck or burnt, becauſe their Soul with meer fear has flown out of their Body like a Bird. Many, as <hi>Euripides</hi> ſays, have been deſtroyed by the very breath of Thunder, for at other times alſo the Hearing is eaſieſt affected of any of the Senſes, thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances and Apprehenſions that proceed from Noiſe, giving always the moſt terrible Alarms to the <hi>Soul.</hi> Beſides it has been obſerv'd, that ſeveral have been ſtupified to that degree by an Earthquake, that they have run up and down like Perſons diſtracted and out of their wits; which ſad Accident, if it ſurprized this poor Woman, as her Husband was making the beſt of his way to eſcape, 'tis no Myſtery that ſhe was not able to ſave herſelf. <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58698:138"/>that this frequently happen'd when <hi>Campania</hi> was ſhaken by an Earthquake, <hi>Sen. Quaeſt. Nat. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1. and in the 38th. Chapter of the ſame Book he aſſigns the following Reaſons for it, for if Fear, even when it is moderate and not ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, makes Men reel up and down as if they were actually mad; what wonder is it, that when the Terror is publick, when Cities fall, when the Earth trembles, when whole Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are Buried in the Ruins, that our Minds, what between Fear and Grief ſhould forſake us.</p>
            <p>'Tis a hard matter not to be concern'd, when we ſee Thouſands before us are ſo, and therefore the moſt reſolute Diſpoſitions were ſo diſorder'd by Fear, that they knew not what they did: Nay Men of the beſt Courage are not exempted from Fear, and the wiſe Stoick was never yet to be ſound, who (as the ſame Philoſopher expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf) cou'd without any manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern behold the dreadful and angry Face of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when it Thunders, tho' the Firmament were diſſolved, and darted its Fires to the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every thing, but eſpecially itſelf. There is not, and never was ſuch a Man in the World, that cou'd behold the Ground breaking under him, and be at the ſame time fearleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd. And can any one therefore think it ſtrange if we ſay, that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, overcome by ſo Tragical a Spectacle, was benummed or fainted away, and conſequently cou'd not ſave herſelf by flight?</p>
            <pb n="265" facs="tcp:58698:138"/>
            <p>If any one ſhall Reply, that this manner of Death does not ſeem probable to them, perhaps 'tis no abſurd Conjecture, that this Woman not only caſt back her Eyes towards her native Country, but went back thither as ſoon as the Angels were gone, to behold the Burning of it nearer, and ſo was ſuffocated by ſome poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vapour; as <hi>Pliny</hi> the Elder was, whom his Curioſity led too near the Mountain <hi>Veſuvius.</hi> And this ſeems to be implied in our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Words, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.32. Where after he had ſaid <hi>Let no Man return back,</hi> i. e. to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after he was once gone out of it, the Siege of it now drawing near, he immediately adds, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> Lot<hi>'s Wife,</hi> who returned back perhaps to ſee whether ſhe cou'd ſave any of her Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Stuff. Nor do the Angels ſeem to have forbidden <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife to look back, as if God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would puniſh her with Death, only for caſting her Eyes back, but that ſhe might not loyter and tarry as thoſe Perſons are uſed to do, who often look behind them out of Love to the place which they leave, or are minded when a Town is deſtroying, to behold at a nearer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance what becomes of it. And the following Words, <hi>and ſtay not in all the Plain,</hi> ſeem to have been added to oblige them to make the greater ſpeed; the Angels therefore advis'd them to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, becauſe as the Deſtruction encreaſed on all ſides, they might be conſumed with the reſt, tho' they only tarried to look on, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens in ſuch Earthquakes and Fire,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:58698:139"/>as are fed and nouriſhed by the Nature of the Soil. <hi>Cornelius Severus,</hi> in his Poem of <hi>Aetna</hi> ſays,</p>

            <p>Namely, ſuch as tarried behind to carry off their Wealth, which perhaps <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife endeavour'd to do, and becauſe ſhe was not removed from the place where ſhe fell, therefore ſhe is ſaid to be like a Statue of Salt in that ſalt Country. Nor is there any reaſon to urge the Emphaſis, ſince we find the ſame Expreſſion uſed about Matters of leſs Importance. In the firſt of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, c.</hi> 25. <hi>v.</hi> 37. the Sacred Hiſtorian ſpeaks thus concerning <hi>Nabal, And his heart was dead within him, and he was changed into a Stone,</hi> that is, after his Wife <hi>Abigale</hi> had recounted to him the Danger he had eſcaped, by her making ſome Preſents to <hi>David,</hi> this fooliſh old Hunks, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Fear or Covetouſneſs, was ſo ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he ſeem'd to be a Stone, and died within ten Days. But altho' <hi>Nabal</hi> is here ſaid to be made a Stone, yet no one will conclude from thence, that he was actually <hi>Metamorphos'd</hi> into a Stone: So in like manner we muſt not ſuppoſe <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was a Statue of Salt, for all ſhe is ſaid to become a Statue of Salt, or in Salt. The Latin Poets have uſed the like Expreſſions to ſignifie a mighty Amazement: Thus <hi>Ovid</hi>

But Men of more acute Underſtandings were aware that ſomething elſe was formerly meant by it. <hi>Niobe,</hi> ſays <hi>Tully,</hi> in his <hi>Tuſc.</hi> 3. was for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuppoſed to be turned into a Stone; becauſe, as I imagine, ſhe was everlaſtingly ſilent in her Grief. <hi>Palaephatus de incred.

But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Truth is this: <hi>Niobe,</hi> after the Death of her Children, cauſed her own Statue to be made, and placed it upon their Sepulchre. We might here obſerve by the bye, that <hi>Niobe</hi>'s Misfortune is ſaid to have happened in <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia;</hi> which Country, as we have remark'd in the former Diſſertation, has a great Affinity with the Valley of <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſince both of them are <gap reason="foreign">

His Conjecture had been far better ſupported, if he had told us that they were ſwallowed up by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58698:140"/>an Earthquake; at that time when <hi>Sipylus,</hi> where they lived, was overwhelmed in ruines, as we obſerved before, and that People in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing times ſaid they were buried by the Gods, becauſe they were cover'd with Earth, without any humane Labour or Aſſiſtance. We might likewiſe take notice, that this Earthquake occaſion'd ſome Lakes near <hi>Sipylus</hi> to make this Misfortune of <hi>Niobe</hi> more like the Death of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife; but here we only regard thoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Expreſſions, from whence theſe Fables aroſe. We will only add, that both of 'em are joined together by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> for the likeneſs of their Deſtruction, <hi>in Admonit. ad Gentes;</hi> p. 65.

            </p>
            <p>The Story of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> one of the Gorgons, ſeems to proceed from the ſame Original. The <hi>Graecians</hi> had been informed by the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> that in the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Ocean, beyond a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle of the Gods, an Iſland was diſcover'd, the Inhabitants of which were cover'd all over with Hair like Beaſts, and appear'd in ſo terrible a ſhape at firſt to thoſe that beheld them, that with Fear and Surprize, they were as it were changed into Stones; which in the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Language, wou'd be thus expreſs'd, <hi>&amp; viderunt, &amp; facti ſunt in lapides;</hi> and they ſaw, and were
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58698:141"/>made into ſtones. The <hi>Greeks</hi> ſo underſtood it, as if Men by only looking upon them were actually turned into real ſtones. Which is full as abſurd as if the words of <hi>Job, c.</hi> 41.19. where he deſcribes the mighty ſtrength of a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and ſays, that <hi>the ſtones</hi> of a Sling are by him turned into Stubble, ſhould be ſo wretchedly miſinterpreted, as if the ſacred Writer affirm'd, there was a certain Beaſt in the World indu'd with that wonderful Vertue, that it cou'd turn the ſtones that were thrown at him into ſtubble. The <hi>Phaenicians</hi> had added, that there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Women in that Iſland, which they call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe perhaps they call'd the Iſland <hi>Gorgah</hi> in their own Language; which word, by an <hi>Arabiſm,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>ſtony Ground,</hi> as that Iſland was, whence the word <hi>Gorgith, i.e.</hi> a Woman of the Iſland <hi>Gorgah.</hi> The word <hi>Garagon</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is uſed by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> when <hi>Gorgon</hi> is formed. The <hi>Phaenicians</hi> had affirm'd it in their Relations, that none of theſe Men cou'd be taken becauſe they fled towards the Mountains, and defended themſelves with ſtones; but that they had taken three Women, who, becauſe they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted their Leaders with tooth and nail, were kill'd by them, and their Skins carried to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> from which place theſe Daughters of <hi>Phorcy</hi>'s were taken by the <hi>Grecians;</hi> one of whom having her Head, which was cover'd with Snakes, cut off by <hi>Perſeus,</hi> it was ſaid to have turn'd Men into ſtones with only looking upon it. That moſt Learned Man <hi>Iſaac Voſſius.</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:58698:141"/>diſcover'd part of this a pretty while ago, and ſhow'd that ſomething of truth lurked under this Fable out of <hi>Hanno</hi> the General of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians;</hi> who, as he tells us himſelf in his <hi>Periplus,</hi> had been as far as theſe places, and from thence brought the <hi>Gorgon</hi>'s Skin home to his own Country. We have more particularly explain'd it than he has done; however, 'tis a moſt certain Obſervation he made, that theſe Fables don't merely ariſe from nothing, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where it happens, but have truth for their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as we find it verified in this inſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel Bochart</hi> has illuſtrated this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with an infinite number of Examples in his <hi>Geographia ſacra,</hi> which every one almoſt is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and therefore I will not give my ſelf the trouble to tranſcribe them here. I will only give one of my own to make it more plainly appear, that the Stile of the Oriental Writers, who always affected bold and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Metaphors, is not to be expounded by our modern way of ſpeaking, which is one of the greateſt Faults the Interpreters of them have committed. When they wou'd find out the Meaning of any Word or Expreſſion, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider how they wou'd be underſtood if they ſpoke ſo now, than how thoſe People who differ no leſs from us in Opinion and Fancy, than they are diſtant from us in relation to time or place, wou'd underſtand them.</p>
            <p>The Fable of the <hi>Harpyes</hi> is well enough known, and we need not otherwiſe expound it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:58698:142"/>than by comparing it with the truth. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To begin with the name, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>How patly this agrees with the Locuſts, will ſufficiently be demonſtrated by theſe words of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Commentary upon <hi>Joel, ch.</hi> 2.

            <p>And ſo in <hi>Joel, ch.</hi> 2.11. the Locuſts are called the Army of the Lord.</p>
            <p>This, as I imagine, ſufficiently ſhows, that the figurative Expreſſions of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unleſs they are rightly underſtood, may occaſion great Miſtakes; and now, no one will admire that we have given another Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Statue of Salt,</hi> than is commonly done, and which the words at the firſt ſight ſeem to intimate.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. From hence we may gather how little Foundation there is in this Expreſſion, <hi>and ſhe was a Statue of Salt;</hi> as likewiſe in the words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> to infer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Converſion of the Bread into the Body of Chirſt; which Paſſage ſome Learned Men in <hi>France</hi> have lately too greedily laid hold of to defend their monſtrous Opinion. We ſhall not here proſecute the other Differences between this Expreſſion and the Words of Chriſt, even though we acknowledged there was a real <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife; for we reſolved to meddle with no Controverſies here, but thought fit to expoſe the Weakneſs of this Argument, being thereunto led by this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that matters are ſo as we have repreſented them, we think we may make bold to affirm, that the common Belief of the Pillar of Salt, wholly proceeded from miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and has been obſtinately maintain'd by the Vanity of ſome,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58698:144"/>and the Credulity of others. Nor is there any reaſon, as we hope we have fully demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to oppoſe the Conſent and Authority of the Ancients to our Opinion, which the moſt bigotted Patron of them will never pretend that they are to be received blindly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination; or when they are proved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a due ſearch to be ill-grounded, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to Reaſon, that they are to be preferr'd before a better. What then? Shall I follow the footſteps of the Ancients? I will indeed follow the beaten road, but if I can find out a nearer and plainer way; I will keep to that. They that writ before us, are our Guides, but not our Maſters. The truth lies open for all; it is not wholly poſſeſs'd as yet, but much of it is ſtill left for the Diſcovery of thoſe that come behind us. <hi>Sen. Epiſt.</hi> 33.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> The great Difficulty of this Place. <hi>II.</hi> That <hi>David</hi> is not meant by it. <hi>III.</hi> Both Jewiſh and Chriſtian Interpreters are of Opinion, that ſomething is here Promiſed, which is to ceaſe at the comeing of the Meſſias. <hi>IV.</hi> The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of ſome Jews Refuted. <hi>V.</hi> Some maintain, that nothing but the Diſſolution of the Jewiſh Monarchy is meant in this Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Reflections upon the Whole.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">I. THere is ſcarce any Place in the whole Bible, which has more employ'd the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Interpreters, than this Paſſage in <hi>Geneſis.</hi> 1. The three <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts, <hi>Onkelos, Jonathan,</hi> and that of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> with ſeverall Rabbines of the ſame Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe Teſtimonies have been Collectd by Learned Men, affirm, that the Remarkable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, whom by way of Excellence they call'd the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> was ſignified by the word <hi>Shilo.</hi> But a very celebrated Rabbine, <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> by name, oppoſes his Country-men, and maintains, that <hi>David</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and afterwards King, was here meant. But altho' we own that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58698:145"/>the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> ever ſince <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſome Prerogative of honour above the reſt; yet in the firſt place, neither <hi>Scepter,</hi> nor <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> belonged more to that, than any of the other Tribes, till <hi>David</hi> was advanced to the Throne: In the common Adminiſtration of Affairs, the other Tribes were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by their Votes, nor had they any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dependence upon them, nay the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> had a King choſen out of their body before that of <hi>Judah.</hi> And therefore it cou'd never be ſaid that <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould have a Scepter and Lawgiver, till <hi>David</hi>'s Elevation to the Regal Dignity; for although it ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, yet in what ſenſe cou'd it be ſaid, that the Kingdom ſhould remain with <hi>Judah,</hi> till the coming of him who fixt the Crown in that Tribe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Some Jewiſh and Chriſtian Interpreters are fully agreed, that ſomething is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> or to the whole body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was to ceaſe at the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or a ſhort time after. Thoſe that maintain the whole Republick of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> deſcended from <hi>Jacob</hi> to be meant here, don't conſider that <hi>Jacob</hi> foretells their Deſtiny in this place, to each Tribe one after another; nor can they produce one ſingle inſtance out of the Scriptures, where the whole People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> are call'd <hi>Judah,</hi> before the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. Neither can it be replied, that <hi>Jacob</hi> might very well give his Poſterity this name,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58698:146"/>becauſe the Holy Ghoſt, who ſpoke out of his Mouth, knew that the time when this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was to be fulfilled, the common name of all the Tribes ſhould be that of the<note n="*" place="bottom">After the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, the whole body of <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> were called <hi>jhudim</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe the firſt that returned home were chiefly of the Tribe of <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Afterwards this name was given to all the reſt, in whatſoever part of the World they reſided.</note> 
               <hi>Jews;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as we obſerv'd juſt before, <hi>Jacob</hi> only ſays ſuch things as belonged to every Tribe in particular, and does not mingle their common lot together; and beſides, if the laſt words of this Prophecy are to be underſtood of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in general, why ſhould not the former be ſo too? and that being once granted, how cou'd the Interpreters ſay that <hi>Shilo</hi> ought to be deſcended from <hi>Judah?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it neceſſarily follows, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar is foretold to the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> in this place. The Ancients were of opinion, that the Adminiſtration of all Affairs in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Republick was in the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> ever ſince the time when <hi>Jacob</hi> pronounced theſe words, to the coming of our Saviour. Now, 'tis certain, that neither before King <hi>David,</hi> nor after <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> any one of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> had the Regal Authority, as all that are never ſo little converſant with ſacred Hiſtory will own. Therefore others acknowledge, that there was indeed no King of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David,</hi> and after <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> but for all that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58698:146"/>maintain, it may truly be ſaid that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Republick ſhould not be utterly diſſolved before the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe out of that Tribe the Common-wealth recovered their ſtrength by degrees, and preſerv'd ſome ſort of Government in their hands, even till the days of Chriſt. But <hi>Jacob</hi> does not promiſe, that the Scepter ſhould continue with <hi>Judah,</hi> and not be wholly taken from him, till the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come, but that <hi>it ſhould not depart from</hi> him; which Expreſſion plainly denotes, the perpetual Continuation of a Kingdom, interrupted by no Calamities.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Some <hi>Jews</hi> are of opinion, that 'tis here prophecy'd of <hi>Judah,</hi> that the <hi>Rod</hi> wherewith he is to be beaten, ſhall not depart from him; but that ſtill one or other ſhall command, and impoſe Laws upon him, till the coming of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But beſides, that the particular words, which compoſe this Prediction, will by no means admit of this Interpretation, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently falſe, whither we underſtand the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> or the whole People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it may eaſily be proved by the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, and particularly the Reigns of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will not purſue this Argument any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which wou'd furniſh matter enough for a large Volume, if it were to be examined with all that Nicety it deſerves. But the Reader may conſult for his farther Satisfaction <hi>Hueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s <hi>Demonſtratio Evangelica, Prop.</hi> 9. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58698:147"/>where he has ſet down all the different Opinions with incredible Pains and Acuracy. To him may be added the <hi>Pugio Fidei, p.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. with the Learned Obſervations of <hi>Joſ. de Voiſin,</hi> where the ſeveral Teſtimonies of the Rabbines chiefly are collected. We ſhall only ſubjoin another Interpretation of this Prophecy, which they have not taken notice of; and ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perhaps upon a due examination will find it to be more agreeable not only to the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Senſe of the words, but alſo to the Events here predicted.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Some Perſons therefore believe, that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> promiſed nothing more to <hi>Judah</hi> in this place, but that when the Regal Dignity had once honour'd his Tribe, it ſhould be tranſlated to no other, but continue there till it was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſhed. The Maintainers of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion interpret <hi>Shiloh</hi> to be the <hi>End</hi> or Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, to wit, of the Scepter and Royal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Now if this were the true Interpretation of the word, there is nothing in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which wou'd occaſion the leaſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for it appears by the ſacred Hiſtory, that from the time that <hi>David</hi> ſate upon the Throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Kings deſcended from him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> without the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of any other Family, till the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> was wholly diſſolv'd. Whereas in the Kingdom of the ten Tribes, even before it was utterly deſtroy'd by <hi>Salmanaſſar,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Dignity did not ſtand in one, but ſeveral
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58698:147"/>Tribes, according to the different Deſcent of their Kings. The chief Objection that can be rais'd againſt this Interpretation will be, that it diſarms the Chriſtians of an Oracle, own'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, whereby they have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully prov'd againſt the latter, that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> was already come. But an Interpreter muſt not always conſider what the <hi>Jews</hi> will give him leave to ſay, or what wou'd be ſerviceable to his Cauſe, if it were true, but what is really conſonant to the Truth it ſelf, no leſs than if there were no ſuch People as the <hi>Jews</hi> now in the World, or if we had never had the leaſt Diſpute with them about the coming of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Though the <hi>Jews</hi> were not miſtaken in their Expectation of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> yet all thoſe places in the Old Teſtament, which out of their former immoderate, and now their prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Deſire of his coming, they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded concerning him, muſt not therefore be affirmed to relate to him, merely becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> think ſo. That the Rabbins have forced ſeveral Paſſages in the Bible to favour the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> without any reaſon on their ſide, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known to thoſe that have either read them, or what the Chriſtians have collected out of their Writings. Therefore as it was a true Tradition of the ancient Jews, that there ſhould come at laſt a Deliverer to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo any unprejudiced Perſon will own that they might ſometimes commit Miſtakes in expounding ſome Text of the O. Teſtament, which they ſuppoſed to relate to him.</p>
            <pb n="284" facs="tcp:58698:148"/>
            <p n="5">V. This we don't ſay with that proſpect, as if we had the Vanity to imagine that this laſt Interpretation of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy ought to take place of all other, whether already found out, or hereafter to be diſcover'd, as being the unqueſtionable meaning of this Paſſage: but that after the Merits of all the other Opinions have been impartially conſidered, it will more plainly appear either on which ſide the Truth ſtands, or where and by what Methods it is to be acquir'd, or laſtly why it cannot be found out?</p>

               <hi>And the Earth brought forth Graſs,</hi> ch. 1.12.] This Verſe is a meer Repetition of the former, which after <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid <hi>and it was ſo,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unneceſſary. But the Hebrew Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are far from that Severity of the Atticks, who could not endure any Superfluities. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things are redundant in the ſacred Volumes, and others defective, which wou'd not a little contribute to the Perſpicuity of the Sentence. However, this is not ſo much to be attributed to their Writers, as to the Condition of their Language, which the moſt partial Patron of it muſt acknowledge to be unpoliſhed and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, though it ſometimes affects, as has been obſerved in the preceding Praragraph, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Genius of the other Oriental Languages, a pompous and magnificent way of Expreſſion.</p>

               <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it,</hi> ch. 2.3.] As one contrary is beſt illuſtrated by another, it will not be <hi>mal à propos</hi> to enquire what is the meaning of <hi>Maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere diis, i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> e.</hi> to curſe a day; that ſo we may
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58698:149"/>underſtand what it is, <hi>benedicere dici,</hi> or to bleſs a day. Among the Hebrews that was ſaid to be a <hi>maledictus dies,</hi> or a curſed day, which the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the Romans <hi>exſecrabiles,</hi> or unauſpicious, by reaſon of ſome remarkable Deſtruction or Calamity which had happen'd on that day. Thus, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 20.14. the Prophet to denote how wretched a Life he lived, <hi>Curſed be the day,</hi> ſays he, <hi>wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my Mother bore me be bleſſed:</hi> That is, let that day be reckoned ominous in all future Ages, for the Birth of an unfortunate Child. The Roman Senate out of a ſervile Compliment to <hi>Nero,</hi> decreed that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina</hi>'s Birth-day ſhould be reckon'd among the <hi>dies nefaſti,</hi> as we find in <hi>Tacitus, Ann.</hi> 14.12. Which Cuſtom the Romans borrowed from the Graecians, and they from the Oriental Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now on ſuch a day they were forbidden to ſhow any publick mirth, or rejoycing in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the unlucky Accident whatever it was, that happen'd on it. Hence <hi>Job</hi> curſing the day of his Nativity, wiſhes, <hi>ch.</hi> 3.7. <hi>that no joy be in it.</hi> And therefore to <hi>curſe a day,</hi> is all one as to pray that it may become execrable and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, and that all Demonſtrations of Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be intermitted upon it; to <hi>bleſs a day</hi> is to wiſh that it may be eſteemed fortunate, and celebrated with publick Rejoycings, and a <hi>bleſſed day</hi> is the ſame with a happy, or a feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val day. From theſe Premiſes it follows, that when God is ſaid to have bleſſed the ſeventh
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58698:149"/>day, we are to underſtand by that paſſage, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um voluiſſe eum diem feſtem haberi, &amp; hilaritèr tranſigi.</hi> However, we are not to infer from this place, that Mankind ever ſince the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adam,</hi> obſerv'd this day as a Feſtival, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> when he relates the Hiſtory of the earlieſt times, frequently takes occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind the Iſraelites of the Original of ſome Rites which he inſtituted; and does not ſpeak as <hi>Adam,</hi> or thoſe that were before him would have done if they had tranſmitted their own Actions in writing, but ſuits himſelf to the Language and Genius of his own times.

               <hi>To ſee what he would call them,</hi> c. 2.19.] Here the famous Axiom of the Rabbines takes place, <hi>Loquitur lex ut filij hominum,</hi> for God did not want the help of <hi>Adam</hi> to give names to the Beaſts. Perhaps this was not done in the compaſs of one day, if as ſome believe, <hi>Adam</hi> viewed all the ſeveral ſorts of Animals, neither is it credible that all the Creatures in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, both wild and tame, and all the Fiſhes, were brought before <hi>Adam</hi> to receive their names. In all appearance thoſe Beaſts and Fowls that are peculiar to <hi>America,</hi> never came upon this Errand, neither will any one I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, preſume that the Fiſhes quitted their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this purpoſe. We have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in our Diſſertation upon the Flood, that the word <hi>all</hi> is frequently applied to ſignify ſome certain kinds, but not <hi>omnia genera,</hi> and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58698:150"/>therefore we may ſuppoſe that with <hi>Eve</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Adam</hi> beſtowed particular names upon ſome of the tamer and moſt common Animals in <hi>Syria.</hi> For what occaſion had <hi>Adam</hi> for Speech and Names of things, ſo long as he was alone?

            <p>Now becauſe this is related in a few words, we muſt not therefore conclude, that it was tranſacted in a few hours, and therefore we lie under no neceſſity to affirm with ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, that by a miraculous and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Effect of the Divine Power all ſorts of living Creatures came in troops to <hi>Adam</hi> to have names beſtowed upon them. 'Tis more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reaſon to believe that words were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by degrees, and that theſe Animals receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their names as our firſt Parents happen'd to behold them, or to talk of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whatſoever</hi> Adam <hi>called every living Creature, that was the name thereof,</hi> ibid.] The Rabbines pretend that theſe names were given them in the Hebrew Tongue; but how preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly this is affirmed, we have plainly ſhown in our Diſſertation about the Hebrew Tongue. Perhaps <hi>Moſes</hi> deſigned to hint in this place that the Invention of a Language, which is of ſuch abſolute neceſſity to all the affairs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, was one of the firſt cares of our firſt Parents: or perhaps the Sovereignty of Man over the Beaſts, is intimated by this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of names upon them. Whence
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58698:150"/>among the Eaſtern People thoſe that had new Maſters, had new names given them by them, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> from <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 41.45. <hi>Eliakim</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> from <hi>Pharoah Necha,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron. c.</hi> 36.4. And <hi>Daniel</hi> and his Companions, by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 1.7. The Rabbines likewiſe, and ſome of the Interpreters, pretend that <hi>Adam</hi> beſtow'd theſe names with great Sagacity and Wiſdom; from whence they conclude, that he was acquainted with their different natures, as <hi>Bochart</hi> endeavours to ſhow, <hi>Hieroz. part</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. But that Learned Man takes it for granted all along, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſpoke He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, ſuch as we find it in the holy Volumes, which as we have already obſerved, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Beſides, thoſe names are ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from ſomething remarkable obvious in the Animals, which any one might have diſcovered at firſt ſight. In ſhort, moſt of the Reaſons of the Hebrew names are ſupported by very ſlight Conjectures, and are by no means to be obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as certainly true, upon ſuch as are well skilled in theſe matters: not to repeat what we ſaid before, that but few of the Animals had names immediately given them, but only as our firſt Parents took notice of them, or knew them by frequent Experiments.</p>

               <hi>And he took one of his ribs,</hi> c. 2.21.] From this, or ſome ſuch ſort of a Narration among the Orientals, <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>Praep. Evang. l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 12. ſeems to have taken what he

               </gap>, both Man and Woman grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and that this Animal afterwards was divided into two parts, one of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Man, and the other a Woman. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rabbines reading this Paſſage in <hi>Plato,</hi> as they were always fond of Monſters and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; they ſoon liked it, and endeavoured to countenance this ſtrange Opinion by ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture abſurdly applied, as particularly <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>Male and Female he created them.</hi> Now that this Doctrine was firſt borrowed from <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and afterwards cruſted over with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Bible to recommend it the better, we ſhall be ſoon convinced if we conſider that the Rabbines had ſeveral other Opinions of the ſame nature, which they took originally out of this Philoſopher, and then publiſhed them as if they had taken them out of the Scriptures, as the notion of the Tranſmigration of Souls, and the like. Therefore we have no reaſon to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> does, that the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binical Expoſitions agree ſo well with <hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine.

            <p>Cain <hi>brought of the fruit of the ground an offering,</hi> ch. 4.3.] <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks this was done by no poſitive Command of God, but merely by the Dictates of nature, which ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him, that as a conſpicuous Reſpect was to be paid to his Maker, ſo he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſhew it by offering thoſe things to him which are moſt eſteemed by Men.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58698:153"/>he was five hundred years old, yet it is not mentioned which of them is the eldeſt.

And therefore <hi>Shem</hi> was born to <hi>Noah</hi> when he was five hundred and two years old, and conſequently was not his firſt-begotten, ſince he began to get Children when he was five hundred years old. And as for <hi>Ham</hi> he is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.24. to be the youngeſt; Whence it neceſſarily follows, that <hi>Japhet</hi> was the eldeſt, who is therefore, tho' by the bye, called <hi>Shem</hi>'s elder Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.21.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, either becauſe the Nation of the Hebrews was deſcended from <hi>Shem,</hi> or becauſe the Rights of Primogeniture were transferred to him, though the ſacred Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry takes no notice of it; he is both here, and ſometimes below, nominated firſt, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Learned Men have imagined.

               <hi>And</hi> Noah <hi>went in and his Sons,</hi> chap. 7.7.] As <hi>Noah</hi> either had no more Children than theſe before the Deluge, or if he had, they were not alive: ſo likewiſe his Sons either had begot no Children before it happened, or elſe had buried them. Whatever ſide the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der choſes, it is evident from hence, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind before the Flood had not peopled many Countries. For if <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family, when he was ſix hundred years old, only conſiſted of three Sons who had no iſſue, we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſuppoſe that ſeveral more had not a more numerous Off-ſpring.</p>

               <hi>Thou ſhalt go to thy Fathers in Peace,</hi> ch. 15.15.] This is a common Periphraſis of Death, like theſe in Latin, <hi>ire ad plures, ire in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem locum. R. Salomon</hi> concludes from hence, that <hi>Therah</hi> who was an Idolater, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented before he died, and that his Soul went to the Mantions of the Bleſſed, becauſe it is here ſaid, that <hi>Abraham</hi> who was a pious Man, and acceptable to God, ſhou'd go to him. But Sr. <hi>Jerome</hi> has rightly obſerved, that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is not to be depended upon, ſince the Good and Bad when they die, are equally ſaid
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58698:155"/>to go to their Fathers. The Hebrews likewiſe mean the ſame thing by this Phraſe, <hi>to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to his People;</hi> which is uſed concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> ch. 25.8. but can be urged no more than the former, ſince 'tis plain that neither was <hi>Abraham</hi> buried with his Country-men the Chaldeans; but purchaſed himſelf a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument in <hi>Canaan:</hi> Neither can his Soul be ſaid when it quitted his Body, to be in the ſame condition with that of the Chaldean Idolaters. However, theſe Phraſes (whatever the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them might afterwards be) ſeem to take their Original from ſuch like Opinion as this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Souls of the Dead go to ſome certain Recepcacles, where every Nation and Family live apart by themſelves. <hi>Ezekiel, ch.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 22. and the following Verſes, ſeems to allude to this Opinion, Aſhur <hi>is there, and all her Company,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he lift up his Eyes, and looked, and lo three Men ſtood by him,</hi> ch. 18.2.] Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that theſe were three Angels in humane ſhape; one of whom, as being chief of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy, came to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the other two went to carry God's Commands to <hi>Lot.</hi> But others are of Opinion, that he who is called <hi>Jehovah, v.</hi> 13, 14, 17, 20, 22. and whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> calls <hi>the Judges of the Earth, v.</hi> 25.27. was the ſecond Perſon of the holy Trinity. But as theſe People make the Divinity aſſume
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58698:156"/>a humane ſhape upon trivial grounds, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo becoming the Divine Majeſty, ſo they have none of the Jews that lived in the Apoſtolical times to countenance their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 'Tis certain, that if <hi>Abraham</hi> did really entertain the higheſt God, the Exhortation of the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, ch.</hi> 13.2. is one of the coldeſt things in the World, <hi>Be not forgetful to entertain Strangers, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome have entertained Angels unawares.</hi> He ought to have added, <hi>nay and God himſelf,</hi> which had made his Argument much more efficacious. However, theſe ancient Stories of the Angels travelling up and down the Earth in humane ſhapes, ſeem to have given occaſion to the Opinion of the Pagans, that the Gods uſed to viſit Mankind. Thus one of <hi>Penelope</hi>'s Suiters in the <hi>Odyſſes,</hi> blames <hi>Antinous</hi> for ſtriking <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes, becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Gods are accuſtomed to travel thro' Towns and Cities in the Diſguiſe of Gueſts, to behold the Manners and Behaviour of Mortals.</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 14, 11. Now it was not the Cuſtom of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers at this time to knock at the Door, or to ſpeak to thoſe Perſons firſt by whom they hoped to be entertained: But they only ſtood in the High-way, waiting till they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and at their departure uſed to receive a <hi>Viaticum</hi> from their Hoſt, to ſupport them upon the Road. For in thoſe Ages there were no Inns in the Eaſtern Countries, no more
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58698:156"/>than there are now a days, except a ſew <hi>Kervanſera's,</hi> as they call them, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Strangers; ſo that they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lye all night in the Streets if they came to any Town, or elſe lye in ſome Body's Houſe who was ſo kind as to receive them. A remarkable Inſtance of this we find in <hi>Judges,</hi> ch. 19.15. Thus likewiſe among the Greeks and Romans, though in the latter Ages they had Inns and Victualing Houſes, yet formerly they had none. Hence came the Faſhion of lodging in private Houſes, and hence Hoſpitality came to be ſo much commended. Upon which Argument conſult <hi>Tomaſinus de Teſſeris.</hi>

               <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>there called on the name of the Lord, the everlaſting God,</hi> ch. 21.33.] Perhaps the ſacred Hiſtorian added this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet here, to diſtinguiſh the true God, whom <hi>Abraham</hi> worſhipped, from thoſe Divinities that were ſometimes born, and were to dye at laſt. If <hi>Philo Byblius</hi>'s <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> was a faithful Expoſitor of the Phaenician Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, thoſe People only own'd two Gods to be eternal, and held that the reſt were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; for after that manner does he explain their Doctrine in <hi>Euſebius, Dem. Evang.</hi> l. 1. c. 10. <hi>He teaches that the firſt Principle of all things was a dark dusky</hi> Air <hi>full of Wind, or the breath of a dusky Air, and a turbid</hi> Chaos,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58698:157"/>
               <hi>encompaſſed with Darkneſs: That theſe were eternal, and had not an end in many Ages.</hi> And afterwards relates the Generations of the Gods, who alone were worſhipt. The Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians believed that the Nymphs were born with Oaks, and that they died along with them; and perhaps they borrowed this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from the Oriental Nations, as they did ſeveral more. Thus we find in <hi>Plutarch, de Oracul. Defectu,</hi> that <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> ſuppoſes thoſe Deities that had been the Preſidents of Oracles formerly to be dead; upon which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the famous Story of the Death of <hi>Pan the Great,</hi> and other Relations of that nature; by which it appears that the Nymphs and Daemons, or their Gods of the lower rank, was commonly believed to be mortal, altho' they were long-lived. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeems to have oppoſed the everlaſting God, who had no beginning, and who is capable of no end; to ſome ſuch ſort of an Opinion received by the Eaſtern People.</p>

               <hi>And there was ſet Meat before him to eat, but he ſaid, I will not eat till I have told my Errand.]</hi> In the ancient times it was uſual to receive Strangers, and entertain them with a Repaſt, before they asked them any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. Thus after <hi>Neſtor</hi> had given a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Meal to <hi>Telemachus, Odyſſes, l</hi> 3. and the other had eaten as much as was ſufficient,

i. e. <hi>after they have filled their Bellies.</hi> Nay, ſometimes ſeveral days paſs'd over their Heads, before they thought fit to lay down the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their coming.

Thus, <hi>Iliad.</hi> 8. <hi>Homer</hi> tells us that the King of <hi>Lycia</hi> entertained <hi>Bellerophon</hi> for nine days ſucceſſively, and that when the tenth Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appear'd, he began to ask him Queſtions. <hi>Dares Phrygius</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Antenon,</hi> who was ſent Ambaſſador to <hi>Peleus,</hi> tells us, that the latter well-comed him for the ſpace of three days, but on the fourth enquired upon what Meſſage he came; <hi>Die quarto rogat eum quid venerit.</hi> After the ſame manner <hi>Laban</hi> here took <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant within doors, and ſet ſome Meat before him, though he had no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, and asked him no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; but the other finding that God had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſent him to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Relations, was in pain till he had delivered his Errand.</p>

               <hi>Tell me I pray thee thy name,</hi> ch. 32.22.] Some Interpreters ſuſpect that <hi>Jacob</hi> knew his Antagoniſt, with whom he wreſtled, to be an Angel, becauſe he deſired him to bleſs him; but then this Paſſage makes them at a ſtand: for how cou'd he imagine to be a jot the better after he knew the Angel's name. We are deſirous to know the names of thoſe, with whom we have any dealing, becauſe when we once know that, we may find out who, and what manner of Men they are, by enquiring of thoſe that are better acquainted with them. But ſince there is no Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between us and the Angels, after we know the names of two or three of them, we know them no more than we did before. Thus <hi>Manoah,</hi> who took the Angel that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him for a Prophet, deſires him to tell him his name, and ſubjoins this reaſon for it, that <hi>when thy Sayings are come to paſs, we may do thee honour;</hi> that is, give thee all the reſpect that is uſually paid to a Prophet. 'Tis true indeed, that the Jews and the other Eaſtern People, talked much of the names of Angels in the following times; but 'tis ſcarce credible that in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s days ſuch Notions were current, nor do we find the leaſt footſtep of them in the Bible before <hi>Daniel.</hi>

               </gap>, and the Vulgar <hi>in infernum.</hi> This word and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tranſlations of it, have not a little em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd the Interpreters of the Old and New
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58698:160"/>Teſtament. We ſhall ſet down the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Significations of it as briefly as we can, and then enquire in what Senſe it is here to be taken. In the firſt place it ſignifies any place below the Superficies of the Earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made hollow by Art or Nature. Hence <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah</hi> metaphorically uſes it to denote a low and mean Condition, <hi>ch.</hi> 14.11. and for the ſame reaſon <hi>Jonas</hi> calls the Fiſh's Belly by the ſame name. Secondly, it is taken for a Grave or Sepulchre, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 14.15. where the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſaid to be brought down <hi>to Hell, to the ſides of the Pit;</hi> which words are there ſet down as Synonimes. See likewiſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 141.7. In the third place it does not ſo much ſeem to ſignify the Grave, as the State of the Dead, or the Place where they are poetically feign'd to reſt, and diſcourſe together. Thus in the 14th Chapter of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah,</hi> the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who is expreſly ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. to be caſt out of the Grave, and to be denied a Burial, is yet in the ninth Verſe ſuppoſed to go <hi>Scholah to Hell,</hi> where the Dead come to meet him. <hi>Hell</hi> (Schol) <hi>from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; it ſtirreth up the Dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the Earth; it has raiſed up from their Thrones all the Kings of the Nations: All they ſhall ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c. ſee <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ch. 32. And by this word is meant not the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58698:160"/>Manſions of the happy, ſuch as the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields, or the fortunate Iſlands, were among the Grecians, but the common Receptacle of the Dead in general, as appears not only by the above-mentioned places, but <hi>Job, c.</hi> 2.17. <hi>ch.</hi> 10.21. and ſeveral other Paſſages of the Old Teſtament. Now 'tis paſt diſpute that it is not here to be taken in the firſt Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification; ſo that the Queſtion is, Whether <hi>Jacob</hi> meant the Grave, or elſe the Place and State of the Dead? It cannot be pretended that he meant the former; for how cou'd he ſay, <hi>I will go down into the Grave to my Son,</hi> ſince he did not believe him to be buried, but to be torn to pieces by a wild Beaſt? Therefore we muſt underſtand it of the Place or State of the Dead, as the LXX Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have done, who have rendred it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and the Vulgar, <hi>Deſcendam ad filium meum lugens in infernum.</hi> But what Sentiments <hi>Jacob</hi> had of that State or Receptacle of the Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, no Circumſtances out of Hiſtory inform us, nor can we ſafely judge of his, by our own Opinion upon that matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are Spies, to ſee the Nakedneſs of the Land are you come,</hi> ch. 42.9.] This Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſo much the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe his Brothers came from thoſe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58698:161"/>parts, by which alone <hi>Aegypt</hi> is acceſſible on the ſide of <hi>Aſia. This is the only place,</hi> ſays <hi>Herodotus,</hi> l. 3. c. 5. <hi>where</hi> Aegypt <hi>can be openly enter'd;</hi> where he relates at large how <hi>Cambyſes</hi> invaded it, and marched with his Army this way. Conſult but <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Tables, and the matter appears plain enough. It was on all ſides ſecured from the hoſtile Incurſions of the <hi>Africans,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Diodorus Siculus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Bibl.</hi> by large unpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Deſerts. The Sea which lies to the Northwards of it, is ſhallow and deſtitute of Harbours, ſo that it did not fear an Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from that quarter: Only on the Eaſtern Frontier it lay open and unguarded. For this reaſon <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> to ſecure his Paſs againſt the Irruptions of the Syrians and Arabians, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified it with a Wall fifteen hundred furlongs in length, which reached from <hi>Peluſium</hi> to <hi>Heliopolis, Diod. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 52. and upon the ſame account perhaps it was that <hi>Nero</hi> the Son of <hi>Pſammetichus,</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> drew a Trench from the <hi>Peluſiac</hi> Arm of the <hi>Nile,</hi> to the Gulf of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and endeavoured to joyn the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> to the Southern Sea.</p>

               <hi>They knew not that</hi> Joſeph <hi>underſtood them, for he ſpoke unto them by an Interpreter,</hi> ch. 42.23.] Although the Aegyptian and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language nearly reſembled one another,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58698:161"/>yet there might be that difference between them, as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> cou'd not underſtand one another in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſcourſe. Thus we ſee the French don't underſtand the Italians or Spaniards, although theſe three Languages are derived from the Latin; and thus in the time of the Kings, the Jews did not commonly underſtand the Chaldean Tongue, as appears from 2 <hi>Kings, ch.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 26. Now 'tis evident from this place, that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons ſpoke in the Canaani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Language, unleſs we wou'd rather ſuppoſe them to ſpeak Chaldee, and not a Tongue which was only peculiar to one Family, as the Rabbines pretend: for then how had it been poſſible to have procured an Interpreter, unleſs we ſuppoſe that one of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had run away from his Maſter, and fled into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of which we don't find the leaſt mention.</p>

Secondly, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that in the Heroical times they uſed long Tables, or <hi>perpetuae menſae,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> calls them: So that the moſt honourable Seat was conſequently at the upper end, where we may ſuppoſe <hi>Reuben</hi> ſate, and his other Brethren below him, according to their Age.

               <hi>The Cup whereby my Lord divineth,</hi> chap. 44.5.] The ſacred Volumes no where take notice of any Divination perform'd by a Cup; and what ſeveral Learned Men have told us of the Effuſion of Wine in the Jewiſh Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices out of a Cup, is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſince it does not at all appear that they gathered any Auguries that way. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grecians indeed made a Judgement of future Events by the noiſe of the Wine poured out in honour of the Divinity, and before their Libations pray'd to the Gods to ſend them ſome auſpicious Signs. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too they threw this Wine into the Fire, and the greater the Flame was, ſo much the better was the Omen. We find in 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 23.16. that Water was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times poured out unto the Lord; but the Scripture in no place informs us that the Jews gather'd any Omens from thence. And therefore as the Greeks borrow'd great part of their Religious Rites from the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, 'tis probable that the latter, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame Method in their Libations, and that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had a reſpect to them here.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That you may dwell in the Land of</hi> Goſhen, ch. 46.34.] 'Tis unqueſtionable that the Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> 'was ſituate in the Lower <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as alſo that it was the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or <hi>Nomus,</hi> which a Traveller coming out <hi>Syria</hi> enters, ſince <hi>Jacob</hi> ſo ſoon as he came thither, ſent to acquaint <hi>Joſeph</hi> with the news of his Arrival. By this place it appears, that it was famous for rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, otherwiſe it wou'd ne're have been offer'd to a Company of Shepherds, as the moſt convenient place in the Kingdom for them. 'Tis likewiſe certain, that this Tract of Land was appropriated to the Aegyptian Shepherds, who lived ſeparate from the reſt of their Country-men: For otherwiſe how cou'd <hi>Joſeph</hi> conclude, that this Province wou'd be aſſigned to his Brethren immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, upon their diſcovering what Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they followed, unleſs it was the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of that Nation ſo to do? As will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by the following words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For every Shepherd is an Abomination to the Aegyptians,</hi> ch. 46.34.] Learned Men are uſed to enquire upon this place the firſt, whether it appears by any Teſtimony out of Prophane Authors, that the Aegyptians avoided the Company of Shepherds? The
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58698:163"/>ſecond, for what reaſon they hated them? As for what regards the former, we don't here mean all Shepherds in general, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as fed <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Goats.</hi> According to <hi>Herodotus, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 164. the Aegyptians were divided into ſeven Claſſes, <hi>Prieſts, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Cow-herds, Hog-herds, Merchants, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, and Sea-men.</hi> As for the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, we no where find that the Aegyptians deſpiſed them, but the above-cited Hiſtorian expreſly affirms ſo much of the Hog-herds, <hi>ch.</hi> 47. where he tells us, that the reſt of the Aegyptians refuſed to have any Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances with them. Among the Mendeſians, if we may believe him, Goat-herds lived in great reputation, becauſe they worſhipped Goats. But theſe ſame People that looked upon it to be a hainous Sin to ſacrifice Goats, thought it no Crime to ſerve Sheep after that manner. The contrary to which was obſerved by the Thebans, as we find in the ſame Author. So far <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who is more particular in this Affair than any one elſe; however, he does not ſeem to conſiſt with himſelf, for ſince he makes two different Ranks of his Hog-herds and Cow-herds, why does he not farther branch them out into Goat-herds and Shep-herds? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with much more reaſon on his ſide. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> comprehends them all under the name
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58698:164"/>of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Paſtors,</hi> but does not acquaint us in what Credit they lived with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aegyptians.</p>
            <p>Now with Submiſſion to Perſons of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Learning, I am of Opinion that as the Aegyptian Superſtition varied with reſpect to Time and Place; ſo that eating of Sheep was held unlawful in the <hi>Tanitic</hi> Kingdom in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s time, and that as the Shepherds did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther really feed upon them, or at leaſt were ſuſpected to do ſo, the reſt of the Aegyptians ſhun'd their Company. Thus they thought they contracted an Impurity if they kiſſed a Grecian, becauſe the latter made no difficulty to eat Cow's Fleſh, which Animal was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ador'd in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> For this reaſon they cou'd not be brought to uſe ſo much as a Knife or a Kettle, if it came out of <hi>Greece,</hi> out of a fear that the Fleſh of a Cow might have been cut by the former, or boiled in the latter. Though we are told by <hi>Herodotus</hi> that the <hi>Mendeſians</hi> uſed to ſacrifice, and conſequently to eat Sheep; yet at the ſame time he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who had a much greater Authority in the Country, abſtained from it: and <hi>Diodorus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 99. reckons Sheep among thoſe Creatures from which the Aegyptians abſtained. Beſides thoſe private Reaſons which the Prieſts aſſign'd for this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58698:164"/>he ſays the following ones were uſed to be given, <hi>viz.</hi> that Sheep brought forth Young twice a year, that they cloathed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind with their Wool, and nouriſhed them with Milk and Cheeſe. And therefore ſince ſeveral of the Aegyptians either for theſe, or ſome other Reaſons, abſtained from Sheeps Fleſh, what wonder is it if they expreſſed an utter Averſion to thoſe Men whom they knew, or elſe ſuſpected to feed upon it, if they ſhun'd their Converſion, and obliged to live by themſelves in a particular Tract of their Country? Indeed ſome Learned Men doubt whether we can diſcover any certain Tokens of Idolatry in <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſo early as the days of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but what they pretend they can no where find; this <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.26. and the Iſraelites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came infected with Idolatry in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> lays it to their charge, <hi>ch.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8.</p>

               <hi>And Joſeph placed his father and his brethren in the land of Rameſes,</hi> ch. 46.11.] Here cannot be ſignified that City, which is ſaid, <hi>Ex.</hi> 1.11. to be built long after the Death of <hi>Joſeph</hi> by the Iſraelites; nor indeed had theſe People, who lived under Tents and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from one Place to another, any occaſion for a City at firſt: Therefore others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it to be part of the Country of <hi>Goſhen.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">I. MEN are ſo fond of <hi>Prodigies,</hi> as to believe often without any Reaſon, that God alter'd the ordinary Courſe of Nature; of which I have given a pregnant Inſtance, in my Diſſertation concerning <hi>the Statue of Salt.</hi> Tho' ſuch an Opinion ought not to be approv'd, becauſe it fills the Minds of Men with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Credulity, expoſes the Sacred Hiſtory to the Contempt and Laughter of Prophane Men, and makes them disbelieve true Miracles and Prodigies; yet we ought to bear with thoſe who entertain it, becauſe it they add ſomething to the Scripture, they take nothing from it; and becauſe their Opinion ariſes from a Mind inclin'd to aſcribe whatever is Great and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to the Divine Power. But thoſe who put a falſe Interpretation upon true and manifeſt Miracles, and dare aſcribe every thing to the ordinary Courſe of Nature, can't be endured, for they came by this Opinion out of Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Pride, which Vices allow them not to admire any thing, or believe any that's unuſual and extraordinary. It may be ſaid further, that becauſe they dare not openly deny ſome Facts grounded upon very good Reaſons, and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Teſtimonies, they endeavour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58698:166"/>the belief of them, whilſt they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs, that any thing happens above the ordinary Courſe of Nature.</p>
            <p>Omitting for the preſent what may be ſaid concerning Prodigies and Miracles in general, I ſhall endeavour to vindicate one of them from the Cavils of ſome Men, by giving a clear Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it. I mean the Paſſage of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> upon the dry Ground, as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. Thoſe who affirm, that all this happened according to the ordinary Courſe of Nature, ſay, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> who knew that Country well, obſerved the time of the Tide, and that the Sea retiring back, as it is wont to do, he might eaſily go from one Shoar to another upon the dry ground; and that being a Cunning Man, he vented among the ignorant Multitude, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy what happened according to the ordinary Laws of Nature. Were it not ſo, ſay they, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had not gone boldly into the Sea as as well as the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and they had not been ſo bold as to follow them, if they had ſeen the Sea divided by a Miracle, leſt he who had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Waters of the Sea, only for the ſake of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſhould bring them back into their Channel, to deſtroy the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> They add, That perhaps the Wind favoured by chance, the Deſign of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and wonderfully encreaſed the <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea, as the Writer of that Hiſtory intimates, when he obſerves,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:58698:167"/>that <hi>The Lord cauſed the Sea to go back by a strong Wind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. 'Tis not my buſineſs at preſent, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the veracity of <hi>Moſes;</hi> it will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhew, that their Aſſertion is contrary to his Words; for theſe Men are ſo confident of their Ability as to think, that they can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Opinion by the very words of the Scripture. Wherefore I ſhall firſt explain the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and before I ſhew how far the Power of God was concerned in this matter, I'llenquire into what could be done by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Second Cauſes; and then I'll ſhew what what God himſelf did towards it, and what was done by the Second Cauſes; Laſtly, I ſhall anſwer the Objections of our Adverſaries.</p>
            <p n="3">III. God ſpeaks thus to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 14.16. <hi>But lift up thy Rod, and ſtretch out thine hand over the Sea, and divide it: and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall go on dry ground through the midſt of the Sea.</hi> It appears from Verſe 20, 21. That <hi>Moſes</hi> received thoſe orders towards the Evening. Then <hi>Moſes</hi> obeying God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſmote the Sea, but it was not preſently divided; for thus we find Verſe 21. <hi>And</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>ſtretched out his hand over the Sea, and the Lord cauſed the Sea to go back by a ſtrong Wind all the Night, and made the Sea dry Land, and the Waters were divided.</hi> When therefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſmote the Sea, there aroſe a ſtrong Wind, which divided the Waters by degrees; for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:58698:167"/>himſelf ſays, that the Wind drove back the Waters of the Sea <hi>all that Night,</hi> that is, almoſt all the Night; for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were already gone into the Sea, in purſuit of the <hi>Iſraelites, in the Morning Watch,</hi> as he ſays V. 24.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> divided the Night into three <hi>Watches;</hi> which being ſo, and ſeeing the Sacred Hiſtory tells us, that the Sea return'd <hi>in the Morning-watch;</hi> 'tis likely, that the Wind blew almoſt 12 Hours together, from Sun-ſetting to Sun-riſing: for the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> departed a little after the <hi>Equinox</hi> of the Spring. If we knew in what Watch of the Day or Night the Sea covered the Shores, or retired from them, we might explain this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more accurately. But ſeeing the Sea Ebs and Flows in twelve Hours, 'tis likely, that it began to go back in the beginning of the Night, and that the <hi>Reflux</hi> was haſtened and encreaſed by a ſtrong Wind: but the next Tide was ſlower, the ſame Wind blowing ſtill, and keeping back the Waves for ſome time; during which interval of time, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went through the dry Channel of the Sea-Let us ſuppoſe, for Example, that the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing return'd to the South, was to flow again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, about the beginning of the Second Watch, if there had been no Wind; the Sea might have gone back, before the Second Watch, by reaſon of the Violence of the Wind, and not have returned to the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Shores of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> but ſome Hours la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58698:168"/>ſo that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might go over during the whole Second Watch; that is, during four Hours at leaſt. Indeed they were already gone through the Sea, before the Morning-watch, in which all the <hi>Egyptians</hi> went into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel and were Drowned.</p>
            <p>Now that we may underſtand how ſo many Thouſands of Men might go through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> in ſo ſhort a time, we ought to conſider two things; Firſt, that the extremity of that Gulph is very narrow, as 'tis granted by all thoſe, who wrote about it, and not above two Miles broad. It was therefore no difficult thing for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> though they were ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to go a great pace through the Channel of the Sea in a few Hours, which otherwiſe could not be underſtood, if it was broader. From whence alſo it follows, that the Sea go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back towards the South, leaves not only the Shores dry, but its very Channel, becauſe of the narrowneſs of the place, unleſs it be deeper in ſome places. I think there is no need I ſhould prove, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went through it at the further end of the Gulph, ſeeing it plainly appears that they did, from the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the place in which they encamped, as it is deſcribed <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It ought to be obſerved, that there was no need the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould run away in Battle aray, and in a long File. A great ſpace having been dryed by the Wind, they might go over in a large Front, as the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:58698:168"/>tried to do it after them; for the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had not been drowned, if few of them had gone together, ſeeing thoſe that were beyond, had been at a great diſtance from thoſe that were in the Front. But all the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were drowned, not one excepted; from whence it is manifeſt, that they went into the Channel of the Sea in a large Front.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. But I muſt conſider more carefully the ſtrength of the Wind which blew upon the Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.29. <hi>The Children of</hi> Iſrael, ſays <hi>Moſes, walked upon dry Land in the midſt of the Sea, and the Waters were a Wall unto them, on their right hand and on their left.</hi> Which words ought not to be taken in a literal ſence, nor thoſe which we find <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.8. <hi>With the blaſt of thy Noſtrils the Waters were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: the Floods ſtood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the Sea.</hi> Who ſees not that this is a Figurative Speech? For
<list>
                  <item>1. God blows not with his <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils,</hi> nor did <hi>Moſes</hi> believe he did, who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es every where, that God hath no humane ſhape,</item>
                  <item>2. There is a great difference between a Heap of Corn and a bulk of Ice; nor could the driving of the Waters into the Ocean be compared to both, but in a Figurative ſence, from whence it appears, that neither of them can be underſtood in a proper ſence.</item>
                  <item>3. Had the Waters been congealed on both ſides, there had been no need of a <hi>Strong Wind</hi> blowing all <hi>that Night,</hi> to uphold its Weight; for from the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58698:169"/>time the Water was divided, and congealed on both ſides, it could not return into the middle Channel, but by the melting of the Ice.</item>
               </list>
In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the Water might be ſaid to be as <hi>as a Wall</hi> unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> becauſe they could not go through it, on the Right hand, or on the Left; nor does any thing hinder, but there might be ſome Water on their Left Hand, in deep Pits, tho' the greateſt part of it was removed to the Right Hand, by the Ebbing of the Sea, and the Ford through which they went was left dry. Thus <hi>Nahum</hi> 3.8. the Sea is ſaid to be <hi>a wall</hi> to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>No. Art thou better</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>than populous</hi> No, <hi>that was ſituate among the Rivers, that had the waters round about it, whoſe ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part was the Sea, and her wall was from the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think therefore, that ſuch was the Diviſion of the Waters of the Red Sea, that when the Wind, which encreaſed its Ebbing, had driven all the Waters, except that which remained in deep Pits, from the further end of the Gulph towards its Mouth, there appeared a large Ford over againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> through which they went to the oppoſite Shore; which could the more eaſily happen, becauſe that Sea being full of Fords, when there happens a greater Reflux then ordinarily, thoſe Fords are left dry; tho' as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, the Wind which God raiſed, drove the Sea farther then ever it was before, or hath been ſince, that we know of.</p>
            <p>Moſt of thoſe, who deſcribed that Sea, ſay that 'tis Fordable. They alſo ſay that it hath
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58698:169"/>a violent Ebbing and Flowing. <hi>P. Belonius</hi> Obſerv. Book II. ch. 67. Speaking of a Town call'd now <hi>Tor,</hi> ſays, That <hi>it is Situated on a high place, for the Sea ſwells ſometimes ſo much, that it overflows the Fields, and ſurrounds the Town with its Waters.</hi> Nor can it be otherwiſe in a Narrow Streight, eſpecially when it reaches from South to North; for the Sea flows from the South, thro' a Narrow Paſſage with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and having no room to Expatiate, it muſt needs be high: on the contrary when it Ebbs, it muſt of neceſſity leave many Fords empty, and the extremity of the Golph almoſt dry.</p>
            <p>However a place out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 136. <hi>v.</hi> 13. may be objected againſt my Hypotheſis. There 'tis ſaid, <hi>That God divided the Red Sea into Parts:</hi> which words ſeem to imply that the Waters were ſo divided by the Wind, as to be driven on the right hand and on the left. But they might be ſaid <hi>to be divided into Parts,</hi> if the Water remain'd on both ſides, tho' it was not heap'd up by the ſtrength of the Wind; for the Water, which return'd towards the South, was ſeparated from that which remain'd in the Northern Pits: Which Water left in thoſe Pits, may be call'd <hi>a Part,</hi> becauſe it was ſeparated from the reſt of the Water by the violence of the Wind.</p>
            <p>We read in the Annals of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that in the Year MCCCCXC. the South-wind blew with ſo great a Violence, that the Water of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> (a moſt ſwift River,) flowing from the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58698:170"/>
               <hi>Leman Lake</hi> to the South, ſtood ſtill a quarter of an Hour. In like manner the Wind might encreaſe the Motion of the Ebbing Sea, and ſtop its Impetuoſity when it flowed again. It was obſerved in <hi>Holland,</hi> in the Year MDCLXXII. that the Ebbing of the Sea laſted Twelve Hours, which hindred the Deſcent of the Engliſh: whether this was the Effect of the Wind, or ſome other cauſe, is not well known. Why therefore could not the Ebbing of the Red Sea laſt longer than it uſually did, through the Divine Will, and return Later to the ſame Shores?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Having thus explain'd the Words of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> which concern the thing itſelf, it will not be needleſs to enquire from what part of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Wind blew. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes, cauſed the Sea to go back by a ſtrong</hi> Eaſt-Wind <hi>all that night,</hi> as our Tranſlation renders it. But I am of Opinion the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Kadim</hi> cannot here ſignifie an <hi>Eaſt-Wind,</hi> becauſe ſuch a Wind was fitter to drive the Floods to the Shore, wherein the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, than to divide the. Waters; unleſs we ſuppoſe that it blew only on a certain part of the Sea, ſo as to hinder the Waters from running in the middle. But who can apprehend how ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Men could, I will not ſay, ſtand in the Channel of the Sea, but go thro' it in ſo ſhort a time, whilſt ſo violent a Whirl-wind blew in their Faces?</p>
            <p>I ſhould think therefore that the Word <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim</hi>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:58698:170"/>denotes not that part of Heaven from whence this Wind blew, but a <hi>Violent Wind,</hi> from whenceſoever it blew. Nor did <hi>Moſes</hi> add the word <hi>ſtrong,</hi> becauſe the Wind call'd <hi>Kadim</hi> is not commonly a violent one; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Wind, which drove the Waters of the Red Sea towards the Ocean, was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violent. The word <hi>Kadim</hi> ſignifies a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Wind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.8. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Job</hi> 27.21 <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Jon.</hi> 4.8. we may therefore underſtand by the word <hi>Kadim</hi> a North-wind. Nor could any other Wind open a paſſage to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thro' the Fords of the Sea, as I have ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The thing it ſelf favours my opinion, as we have ſeen, and no ſtrong Argument can be brought againſt it from the words of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Some therefore will perhaps endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it ſome other way, <hi>Viz.</hi> by accuſing it of Novelty. But I may ſhelter my ſelf under the Authority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who ſeems to have had the like thoughts, when he compared the Paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with <hi>Alexander</hi>'s March thro' the Sea of <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> in theſe words, Book II. towards the End: <hi>No Body will admire that ſtrange Story, that Men, who liv'd many Ages ago, and were free from malice found a way to eſcape, even thro' the Sea, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God would have it ſo, or whether it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd by chance; ſeeing the Sea of</hi> Pamphylia <hi>gave way to</hi> Alexander <hi>King of</hi> Macedonia, <hi>who liv'd not long ago, and open'd a Paſſage to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58698:171"/>him, when he had no other, when God deſign'd to deſtroy the Empire of the</hi> Perſians. I ſhall not enquire whether thoſe Two Events may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd in every thing: 'tis falſe that <hi>Alexander</hi> had no other way, and they differ in other things: But however it appears from thoſe words that <hi>Joſephus</hi> believe, not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Paſſage was like that of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in this, <hi>Viz.</hi> in his going thro' the Sea, when the Wind turn'd, which he could not do, whilſt it blew. I ſhall here ſet down the words of <hi>Arrianus,</hi> who relates the thing thus, Book I. <hi>He lead thoſe who were with him thro' the Sea all along the Shore. No Body can go that way, but when the North-Wind blows; but if the South-Wind blows hard, none can go thro' the Shore. It happen'd then, not without the Will of God (as he, and thoſe that were with him ſaid) that a violent South-Wind turn'd into the North, and ſo he had a quick and eaſie Paſſage.</hi> It appears from thoſe words of <hi>Arrianus,</hi> who relates the thing, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> underſtood it, that this latter Hiſtorian had the ſame thoughts as I have concerning the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thro' the Red Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> might alſo have added out of <hi>Livy</hi> Book XXVI. Ch. 45. if he knew it, what that Hiſtorian ſays concerning the taking of <hi>New Carthage</hi> by <hi>P. Scipio Africanus,</hi> to ſtop there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Mouth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who denied the Truth of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The Words of <hi>Livy</hi> run thus: <hi>As ſoon as he was
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58698:171"/>told the Sea Ebbed, he lead his Army to it, becauſe he heard from ſome Fiſher Men, who had been there in ſome light Boats, and were gone thro' the Fords, when their Boats ſtuck, that he might eaſily go to the Wall of the Town a foot. It was about the middle of the day, and beſides the Water was going back according to its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ebbing,</hi> a violent North-Wind <hi>aroſe blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame way the Sea Ebbed, which ſo laid open the Fords, that in ſome places the Water came only to the Belly, and in other places ſcarce to the Knee.</hi> Scipio <hi>having carefully obſerv'd this, and aſcribing it as a Prodigy to the Protection of the Gods, who open'd a new way for the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>thro' the Sea, he commanded his Souldiers to follow</hi> Neptune <hi>as their Guide.</hi> But neither <hi>Scipio</hi> nor <hi>Alexander</hi> could know that the North-Wind would blow, when it was neceſſary for them: And ſeeing the Providence of God ruled the Actions of the Heathens, not only thoſe of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> nothing hinders but he might ſometimes deſignedly help Natural Cauſes on their behalf.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It appears alſo from the Death of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that the Sea was divided, as I have ſaid. Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, that when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went into the Sea, <hi>The Egyptians purſued and went in after them,</hi> in the Night-time, <hi>to the midſt of the Sea, even all Pharaoh's Horſes, his Chariots, and Horſe-men,</hi> Exod. 14.23. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> believed that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> took hold of the Opportunity of an Ebbing, which was
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58698:172"/>greater than it uſed to be; and that therefore they ought preſently to purſue them, leaſt the Paſſage ſhould be ſtopt by the return of the Waters. Tho' the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were tranſported with anger, yet, had they ſuſpected that it was a Prodigy, they had certainly never been ſo mad as to go into the Channel of the Sea; and they might have ſeen that it was undoubtedly a Miracle, were it not that they might with ſome likelyhood aſcribe the thing to an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Reflux.</p>
            <p>When the whole Army of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> came into the Sea, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> got to the oppoſite Shore, that is, in the Third Watch of the Night, as we learn from what follows, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was commanded to ſmite the Sea, which being done, Exod. 14.27. <hi>The Sea return'd to its ſtrength, when the morning appear'd.</hi> Which ſeems not to have happen'd by degrees, but God made uſe of an extraordinary South-Wind, which brought back with a great violence and in a very ſhort time the Waves, which ſtood ſtill by the ſtrength of the North-Wind. This we learn from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Song, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Thou didſt blow with thy Wind, the Sea covered them: They ſank as lead in the mighty Waters,</hi> &amp;c. If the Waters were congealed and heaped up on both ſides, what need was there of a Wind, to make them return to their place? As they ſtood up only by the Will of God; they might return into their Channel by the ſame Will, provided God would have recall'd the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:58698:172"/>Efficacy of his Power; for they had dropt down by their weight like melted Ice.</p>
            <p>Leſt the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould avoid by flying the violence of the Reflux, beſides the South-Wind by which it was haſten'd, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, That God <hi>Troubled the Hoſt of the Egyptians, and took off their Chariot-wheels, that they drave them hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily,</hi> Exod. 14.24, 25. That we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand this, we muſt remember that the Army of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> was made up only of Chariots and Horſe-men. For <hi>Pharaoh</hi> brought with him no Infantry, to overtake more eaſily the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> nor did he want any, ſeeing he might eaſily rout an unarm'd People only with his Chariots and Horſe-men. Beſides the March of the Horſe-men and Chariots was made ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by a ſecret Efficacy of the Divine Power, Three things might make that Paſſage more difficult to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> than to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. There might be in ſome Places abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Mires too deep to drive Chariots and Horſes thro' them without great trouble; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Men a Foot might eaſily get over them, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were uſed to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with their Flocks in the Marſhes of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Tho' the Bottom of the Sea is not the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, yet no Body will wonder, that I ſay there might be here and there ſome Miry Places in a Space, that was ſome Miles Broad, a little while after the Sea left it.</item>
               <item>2. If there were no Mires in ſome places there
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58698:173"/>was abundance of deep Sand, in which Wheels will ſink deeply, and thro' which Horſes can go but ſlowly. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſays Book III. There is a vaſt quantity of Dirt and Sand in that Sea, and that the Floods ſometimes carry ſo much Sand about the Ships that Sail in it, that they ſtick faſt in the Ground. That Sand hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered without doubt the Chariots and Horſes from going faſt. If it be objected that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays ſeveral times that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went thro' the Sea as thro' a <hi>Dry</hi> Land; I anſwer, It ought not to be ſo underſtood, as if the Channel of the Sea had not been ſo much as moiſt and dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Land is ſaid to be <hi>Dry,</hi> becauſe there was no Waves upon it, and it is oppoſed not to Moiſtneſs but to Water, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.9. <hi>And God ſaid, let the Waters under the Heaven be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together unto one place, and let the Dry Land appear</hi> — <hi>and God called the Dry Land Earth.</hi> See alſo Chap. 8.13. <hi>Philo</hi> therefore laid too great a ſtreſs upon that Word, when he ſaid that the <hi>Iſrelites</hi> went thro' the Sea <hi>as thro' a way paved with Stones; for,</hi> (as he goes on) <hi>the Sand grew hard, and made one ſolid Body.</hi> Miracles have been often invented, (to explain ſome Words of Scripture upon which they put too literal a Senſe) of which the Holy Writers never ſo much as dream'd.</item>
               <item>3. The Bottom of the Sea being uneven, and full of Rocks and<note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Theophras.</hi> Hiſt. of Plants. Book. IV. ch. 8.</note> Shrubs, could not give a
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:58698:173"/>Free paſſage to the Chariots. Nay, 'twas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible for thoſe, who drived the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and haſtened to purſue the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Night time, and then to make their eſcape to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Shores, not to encumber and hinder one another, and even to overturn their Chariots, and break the Wheels againſt the Rocks. Now ſome Chariots overturned or broke, were ſufficient to diſturb the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and it could go but ſlowly, whilſt their Ranks were broke, and every Horſeman endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to go faſter then another. This <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to teach us in the words I have quoted. All which things I have mentioned, did without doubt hinder the march of the Horſe and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots.</item>
            </list>
            <p>When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw this, beſides they perhaps obſerved that the Wind was turned, knowing that the Sea would preſently flow in, they began to think more ſeriouſly of making their eſcape. Then at laſt they perceived, that the God of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was not leſs Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in the Sea, then he had been in <hi>Egypt.</hi> So that condemning their raſhneſs, they turned back, and made haſte to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Shoar; but the Waves breaking upon them they were Drowned. <hi>Joſephus</hi> not only ſays, that the Water of the Sea was driven on the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by the Wind, but alſo, that there aroſe at the ſame time a violent Storm, which perhaps he learned from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts of his time. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> added, that their Anceſtors were
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58698:174"/>forced to come home, and leave off purſuing the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by reaſon of the Storms, as it appears from <hi>Juſtin, Book</hi> 26. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. But <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, that they all Periſhed in the Sea, and that not one of them eſcaped to bring the News of their Calamity. From whence one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by the bye, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> omitted that part of the Tradition of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe it was contrary to the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but willingly alledged, according to his Cuſtom, that part which was not inconſiſtent with it.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If the Hiſtories of <hi>Manetho,</hi> and of ſome others, who wrote the Antiquities of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were extant, we might perhaps find in them ſeveral Footſteps of the Truth, which <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who made uſe of them did not ſee. Indeed 'tis certain, as ſeveral Learned Men have obſerved, that in the Fragments which he hath preſerved to us, there are many things which he underſtood not well. There is ſomething in <hi>Strabo, Book</hi> XVI. which ſeems to belong to the paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thro' the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> tho' he ſays it happened in a Neighbouring Country. <hi>A wonderful and extraordinary thing,</hi> ſays that Author, <hi>is reported to have happened in the Shoar between</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Ptolemaïs. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>That the Inhabibants of</hi> Ptolemaïs, <hi>having engaged in a battle with General</hi> Sarpedon; <hi>and being put to flight, were overwhelm'd as they fled, by the Sea coming upon them as a Tide; and that ſome were carried into the Sea, and others left dead in ſome low Places. Afterwards, when
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:58698:174"/>the Sea Ebbed, their Bodies were found lying promiſcuouſly among dead Fiſhes.</hi> What happen'd in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> was transferred to the Shoars of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and diſguiſed with falſe Circumſtances. The word <hi>Sarpedon</hi> was alſo falſly accounted a Proper Name; for <hi>Sar-Phadon</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the <hi>Head of Deliverance,</hi> or of thoſe who are Delivered, which <hi>Encomium</hi> ſuits <hi>Moſes</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> heard the <hi>Troglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditae</hi> report a like thing. <hi>'Tis reported,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by the</hi> Ichthyaphagi, <hi>who live near that Sea, as they have it from their Anceſtors, that there having been a</hi> GREAT REFLUX, <hi>the whole Channel of the Gulph was dried up, and lookt Green: And when the Earth had been ſeen at the bottom, a violent Flowing came in of a ſudden, and reſtored the Channel to its former State.</hi> Which Words deſcribe the thing well enough, as I have ſhewed that it happened.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if the <hi>Ichthyophagi</hi> ſaid nothing elſe, they were more modeſt than ſome Chriſtians, who having made themſelves Maſters of thoſe places, have corrupted every thing with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of feigned Tales; an Example of which we find in <hi>Oroſius.</hi> Book I. Ch. 10. <hi>There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſome certain Monuments of that event. For the</hi> Track <hi>of the Chariots and Wheels may be ſeen, not only in the ſhore, but alſo at the bottom, as far as the ſight can reach, and if it be confounded, either by chance or out of curioſity, it is of a ſudden divinely reſtored to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:58698:175"/>its former ſtate, by the Winds and Waves; that whoſoever learns not to fear God, by applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Religion, which he knows may be terrified by an ancient Example of God's Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. I have hitherto ſufficiently ſhewed, how God opened a paſſage for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> but I have not ſhewed yet what was done by the ordinary Laws of Nature, and what by an extraordinary effect of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power: What happens after the latter manner, is called <hi>a Miracle</hi> in the Stile of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but Events of the former kind go not by that Name. Again, There are two ſorts of things which God does above the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſome are ſuch, as cannot be aſcribed to natural Cauſes, as things are now: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, If a body heavier than another goes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, as if an Iron thrown into the Water ſinks not, if a humane Body remains in the midſt of Flames without being hurt in the leaſt, and the like. Others being conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, might be lookt upon as the Effects of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes, ſuch are an extraordinary Wind, and Reflux of the Sea. Natural Cauſes may produce them, and often do it: But if God does thoſe things and the like, by an Act of his Will, without uſing natural Cauſes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting the Order he eſtabliſhed from the beginning of the World; then, I ſay, what was not a Miracle by its Nature, is rightly called ſo. If God by his ſpecial Will raiſes a Wind, when
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:58698:175"/>no Wind had riſen by the ordinary Courſe of Nature, and drives the Waves much farther than they uſed to go, when the Reflux had not been greater than it uſed to be by the ordinary Laws of Nature, thoſe things are call'd Miracles, and are really ſo.</p>
            <p>There might be therefore Miracles of both ſorts in what happen'd to the Red Sea. Perhaps the North-Wind had not blown, if God had not raiſed it, and cauſed the South-Wind to ceaſe. Perhaps the ſtrength of that Wind was ſo great by the Will of God, that no Natural Wind could have removed the Sea ſo far. The ſame may be ſaid of the Reflux: Perhaps the Sea had not returned back when it did, if God had not removed it, nor would it, by its natural Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, have gone back ſo far as to leave a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage Large enough for ſo many Thouſands of Men.</p>
            <p>This therefore muſt be granted to us, even by obſtinate Men, that there might be ſome <hi>Miracles</hi> properly ſo call'd in that Event; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the thing happen'd, as 'tis related, which I think I may now take for granted. But it will be ask'd, how ſhall we know that thoſe things happn'd, not by Natural Cauſes, but by an Extraordinary Effect of God's Power? In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which, I ſay, Firſt, that the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtrenth of the Wind, and the Reflux which was ſo great, that perhaps the like was never ſeen, ſhew the Power of God in them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:58698:176"/>if nothing Extraordinary happen'd, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> had no reaſon to rejoyce, nor the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> to be Terrified, when they ſaw themſelves ſhut up between the Sea and the Mountains, for they might eſcape by expecting the Reflux of the Sea; nor is it likely that ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Men knew nothing of the Nature of the Ocean, from which their former Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was but a few days journey diſtant. Laſtly, it was alſo a <hi>Miracle</hi> in this reſpect, <hi>Viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> who could expect nothing elſe but an Ordinary Reflux, foretold the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould periſh, but that they themſelves ſhould eſcape without any damage. <hi>Fear ye not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſtand ſtill, and ſee the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lord, which he will ſhew to you to day: for the Egyptians, whom ye have ſeen to day, ye ſhall ſee them again no more, for ever.</hi> Could any Humane Prudence foreſee that, and that there would be a place in the Channel left dry, and ſo large, that ſo many Thouſands of Men might go thro' it in few Hours without any danger; and that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould be ſo blinded as to follow the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> thinking there was nothing Extraordinary in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? If it be ſaid, that God revealed this to <hi>Moſes,</hi> we have what we deſire, for the very Revelation will be a great Miracle. When a Miracle is foretold, before it happens, 'tis a moſt certain <hi>Criterium</hi> of ſuch a Miracle; for from thence it may be evidently inferred, that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:58698:176"/>God bears a Special Love to Him, whom he thus forewarns; and that an Extraordinary thing happen'd, which could not be known if God had not been pleaſed to fortel it.</p>
            <p>Indeed if an Event, which is not manifeſtly above the Power of Nature, were not foretold, it could not be ſaid, after it hath happen'd, to be moſt certainly a Miracle wrought in the behalf of thoſe, to whom it hath been beneficial. For who ſees not that a prudent Man may ſuddenly make uſe of an unexpected Event tho' it hapens not in his behalf? Wherefore tho' the Wind had not turn'd without a Miracle, when <hi>Alexander</hi> paſſed at the foot of Mount <hi>Climax,</hi> yet he could not boaſt of it as of a ſpecial favour of the Deity, for how could he ſhew that God hath done it in his behalf? He went thither to ſee whether he could go that way, deſigning either to ſtay ſometime till that way might be paſſable, or to lead his Army another way. This <hi>Strabo</hi> Book XIV. intimates clearly enough; <hi>There is a ſtreight of the Sea near</hi> Phaſelis, ſays he, <hi>thro' which</hi> Alexander <hi>led his Army. For there is a Mountain call'd</hi> Climax, <hi>which lies near the Sea of</hi> Pamphylia, <hi>and leaves a narrow paſſage in the Shore, which is Dry when the Sea is Calm, ſo that Travellers may go thro' it, but when the Sea flows in, it is for the greatest part cover'd with Water. The way thro' the Mountain goes a great way about, and is difficult: They go thro' the Shore in fair Weather.</hi> Then he adds, Alexander <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58698:177"/>to be there in Stormy Weather, and becauſe he relied much on Fortune, he ſat out before the Waves,</hi> were calm'd, <hi>and ſo he and his Army marched all the day in the Waters to the Belly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it clearly appears that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> boldly made uſe of that opportunity, which had been more convenient, if he had not been ſo haſty; and therefore if he boaſted that God had open'd a way for his Army, 'twas a meer <hi>Stratagem</hi> he uſed to encourage his Soldiers. Which perhaps was the reaſon why <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf made no mention of any Miracle wrought in his behalf, in his Epiſtles, wherein be ſpoke of that Expedition, as we learn from <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life. <hi>His March thro'</hi> Pamphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, ſays he, <hi>hath been a Subject which many Hiſtorians have treated Eloquently to raiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and ſwell their Style, as if the Sea had gone back by the Will of God—But</hi> Alexander <hi>himſelf in his Epiſtles mentions no Miracle, and only ſays, that having ſet out from</hi> Phaſelis, <hi>he went thro' Mount</hi> Climax.</p>
            <p>From whence it appears, how great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between the Paſſage of <hi>Alexander</hi> thro' the Shore of the Sea of <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and the Paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thro' the Red Sea, not to ſay that <hi>Alexander</hi> might have gone another way, <hi>Viz.</hi> thro' the Mountain, whereas the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> could not go thro' the Mountains. The approach of the Soldiers of <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> to the Wall of <hi>Carthage</hi> does not leſs differ from
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:58698:177"/>the Paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and tho' that Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Man aſcribed it as a Miracle to the Gods, to be more chearfully obeyed by his Soldiers; yet he durſt not aſſure them that the Town would be certainly taken, and if that <hi>Stratagem</hi> of his had not well ſucceeded, his vain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking had not been perhaps ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="10">X. I think I have ſufficiently clear'd both the Hiſtory of the Paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thro' the Red Sea, and what <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; whom I have not alledged, as if I relied much upon his Authority, in things of that nature; but becauſe ſome Learned Men, whoſe Authority ought not to be ſlighted in the Common-wealth of Learning, are more moved with his Teſtimony than with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They and their like Object ſometimes the Novelty of an Opinion, which they read no where elſe, as if it were a certain ſign of Falſhood, and can't reſt contented without the Teſtimony of an Ancient Author. But I have eſpecially endeavour'd to ſatisfie thoſe, to whom too great a Love of Prodigies and wonders of ſome Mean and Imprudent Interpreters hath given occaſion to doubt of the Truth of ſome Ancient Hiſtories. For I have often obſerved that the Doubts of ſome Men, who are no Fools, ariſe from their judging of very Ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, not after a careful Examination, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common opinion of thoſe with
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:58698:178"/>whom they live. Which is certainly very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; for can any thing be more repugnant to Juſtice and Equity than for a Man to give his Verdict, not as the Cauſe, which he ought to know perfectly, requires, but as he, that pleads that cauſe, defends it. If any one thinks I have not well pleaded the Cauſe I took in hand, I ſhall be glad to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and as willing to hear another as if I had never thought of, nor writ on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
